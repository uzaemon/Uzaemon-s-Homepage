<h2>
zlib README</h2>

<p><br>zlib 1.1.3 is a general purpose data compression library.&nbsp;
All the code
<br>is thread safe.&nbsp; The data format used by the zlib library
<br>is described by RFCs (Request for Comments) 1950 to 1952 in the files
<br>ftp://ds.internic.net/rfc/rfc1950.txt (zlib format), rfc1951.txt (deflate
<br>format) and rfc1952.txt (gzip format). These documents are also available
in
<br>other formats from ftp://ftp.uu.net/graphics/png/documents/zlib/zdoc-index.html
<p>All functions of the compression library are documented in the file
zlib.h
<br>(volunteer to write man pages welcome, contact jloup@gzip.org). A usage
<br>example of the library is given in the file example.c which also tests
that
<br>the library is working correctly. Another example is given in the file
<br>minigzip.c. The compression library itself is composed of all source
files
<br>except example.c and minigzip.c.
<p>To compile all files and run the test program, follow the instructions
<br>given at the top of Makefile. In short "make test; make install"
<br>should work for most machines. For Unix: "configure; make test; make
install"
<br>For MSDOS, use one of the special makefiles such as Makefile.msc.
<br>For VMS, use Make_vms.com or descrip.mms.
<p>Questions about zlib should be sent to &lt;zlib@quest.jpl.nasa.gov>,
or to
<br>Gilles Vollant &lt;info@winimage.com> for the Windows DLL version.
<br>The zlib home page is http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/
<br>The official zlib ftp site is ftp://ftp.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/
<br>Before reporting a problem, please check those sites to verify that
<br>you have the latest version of zlib; otherwise get the latest version
and
<br>check whether the problem still exists or not.
<p>Mark Nelson &lt;markn@tiny.com> wrote an article about zlib for the
Jan. 1997
<br>issue of&nbsp; Dr. Dobb's Journal; a copy of the article is available
in
<br>http://web2.airmail.net/markn/articles/zlibtool/zlibtool.htm
<p>The changes made in version 1.1.3 are documented in the file ChangeLog.
<br>The main changes since 1.1.2 are:
<p>- fix "an inflate input buffer bug that shows up on rare but persistent
<br>&nbsp; occasions" (Mark)
<br>- fix gzread and gztell for concatenated .gz files (Didier Le Botlan)
<br>- fix gzseek(..., SEEK_SET) in write mode
<br>- fix crc check after a gzeek (Frank Faubert)
<br>- fix miniunzip when the last entry in a zip file is itself a zip file
<br>&nbsp; (J Lillge)
<br>- add contrib/asm586 and contrib/asm686 (Brian Raiter)
<br>&nbsp; See http://www.muppetlabs.com/~breadbox/software/assembly.html
<br>- add support for Delphi 3 in contrib/delphi (Bob Dellaca)
<br>- add support for C++Builder 3 and Delphi 3 in contrib/delphi2 (Davide
Moretti)
<br>- do not exit prematurely in untgz if 0 at start of block (Magnus Holmgren)
<br>- use macro EXTERN instead of extern to support DLL for BeOS (Sander
Stoks)
<br>- added a FAQ file
<p>plus many changes for portability.
<p>Unsupported third party contributions are provided in directory "contrib".
<p>A Java implementation of zlib is available in the Java Development Kit
1.1
<br>http://www.javasoft.com/products/JDK/1.1/docs/api/Package-java.util.zip.html
<br>See the zlib home page http://www.cdrom.com/pub/infozip/zlib/ for details.
<p>A Perl interface to zlib written by Paul Marquess &lt;pmarquess@bfsec.bt.co.uk>
<br>is in the CPAN (Comprehensive Perl Archive Network) sites, such as:
<br>ftp://ftp.cis.ufl.edu/pub/perl/CPAN/modules/by-module/Compress/Compress-Zlib*
<p>A Python interface to zlib written by A.M. Kuchling &lt;amk@magnet.com>
<br>is available in Python 1.5 and later versions, see
<br>http://www.python.org/doc/lib/module-zlib.html
<p>A zlib binding for TCL written by Andreas Kupries &lt;a.kupries@westend.com>
<br>is availlable at http://www.westend.com/~kupries/doc/trf/man/man.html
<p>An experimental package to read and write files in .zip format,
<br>written on top of zlib by Gilles Vollant &lt;info@winimage.com>, is
<br>available at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html
<br>and also in the contrib/minizip directory of zlib.
<br>&nbsp;
<p>Notes for some targets:
<p>- To build a Windows DLL version, include in a DLL project zlib.def,
zlib.rc
<br>&nbsp; and all .c files except example.c and minigzip.c; compile with
-DZLIB_DLL
<br>&nbsp; The zlib DLL support was initially done by Alessandro Iacopetti
and is
<br>&nbsp; now maintained by Gilles Vollant &lt;info@winimage.com>. Check
the zlib DLL
<br>&nbsp; home page at http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll
<p>&nbsp; From Visual Basic, you can call the DLL functions which do not
take
<br>&nbsp; a structure as argument: compress, uncompress and all gz* functions.
<br>&nbsp; See contrib/visual-basic.txt for more information, or get
<br>&nbsp; http://www.tcfb.com/dowseware/cmp-z-it.zip
<p>- For 64-bit Irix, deflate.c must be compiled without any optimization.
<br>&nbsp; With -O, one libpng test fails. The test works in 32 bit mode
(with
<br>&nbsp; the -n32 compiler flag). The compiler bug has been reported
to SGI.
<p>- zlib doesn't work with gcc 2.6.3 on a DEC 3000/300LX under OSF/1 2.1
<br>&nbsp; it works when compiled with cc.
<p>- on Digital Unix 4.0D (formely OSF/1) on AlphaServer, the cc option
-std1
<br>&nbsp; is necessary to get gzprintf working correctly. This is done
by configure.
<p>- zlib doesn't work on HP-UX 9.05 with some versions of /bin/cc. It
works
<br>&nbsp; with other compilers. Use "make test" to check your compiler.
<p>- gzdopen is not supported on RISCOS, BEOS and by some Mac compilers.
<p>- For Turbo C the small model is supported only with reduced performance
to
<br>&nbsp; avoid any far allocation; it was tested with -DMAX_WBITS=11
-DMAX_MEM_LEVEL=3
<p>- For PalmOs, see http://www.cs.uit.no/~perm/PASTA/pilot/software.html
