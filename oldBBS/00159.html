> I had some problems with compiling SNDM. As it seems, the installation script could not create the RPG program(s). Can I send you the spoolfiles I got after compilation?<br>
<br>
Yes, but please answer to the followings questions before you send the compile lists.<br>
<br>
? What is the version of your OS/400 ?<br>
? Do you have library QSYSINC on your AS/400 ?<br>
? Did you run CHGCURLIB command before MAKE ?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
