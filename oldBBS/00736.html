Thank you very much for your feedback. You've resolved your own requirement ("658. SNDM - More attachments" <a href="http://hpmboard1.nifty.com/cgi-bin/thread.cgi?user_id=MXA02134&disp_no=658&log_no=658&msg_per_page=50&def=10" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://hpmboard1.nifty.com/cgi-bin/thread.cgi?user_id=MXA02134&disp_no=658&log_no=658&msg_per_page=50&def=10</a>) by yourself. In this case, it seems that "opensource" policy worked very well.<br>
<br>
Good luck and have fun.<br>
