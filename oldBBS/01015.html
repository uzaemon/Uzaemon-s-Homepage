> The libtiff download is version 3.4.0. Current libtiff is 3.8.0. Do you have any plans to release a more current version? If not, am I correct in presuming that what you have done is plug values in the header files? Could you tell me what you changed so that I can compile 3.8.0 on my iSeries?<br>
<br>
I ported libtiff to convert TIFF file generated by HPT to PDF using TIFF2PDF command. As it is working fine so far, I have no reason to update libtiff. I don't know why you need 3.8.0, but if you want to examine what I did, search string "AS400" by using option 25 of PDM. You may need to modify MAKE procedure if new modules has been added to libtiff.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
