<br>
My pleasure :-)<br>
<br>
> One question; I've made some programs which create an "on-the-fly" SNDM command which is executed afterwards.<br>

Yes, assuming that you can modify the program by yourself and CPP allows the length of command string. See SNDM command help (Restrictions, 2) for the reason of the limitation.<br>
