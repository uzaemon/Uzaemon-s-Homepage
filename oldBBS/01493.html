Vidan,<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your interest on my tools.<br>
<br>
> You have excellent tools. I appreaciate them very much. Ola Japan !<br>
> I work in a SW house. We have a SW that we sell. This SW produces spoolfiles. As a result of a request from one customer, we wish to enable customers to optionally ship the spoolfile to their mail.<br>
> To do this we can use many solutions among them SNDDST. As your SNDM has a nice advantage (also in some other Java solutions) that almost no preperation is needed, we wish to save the custome the time to download your tool and we wish to distribute it in a separate library alongside our SW. If you see this as a problem - offending your rights, we shall not do so.<br>
> In my opinion - SNDM should become the standard.<br>

> If you require a low one time payment for all tools on your site (I have to look at SPL2STMF and perhaps at CRTCSVF), please specify it and I will have to raise it to managment. They will probably not like it, but I think that I have a chance to convince them if the price is realy low.<br>
<br>
Basically, SNDM is free software, which means you can modify, distribute, bundle it under the terms of GPL.<br>
<br>
In my understanding, it is possible to use GPLed software for commercial use. There are some issues regarding "dynamically links". I don't think programs which call SNDM are considered to be "derivative work". For more information, refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL</a>, for instance.<br>
<br>
SNDM is subject to the dual-license which means you can use whichever you want. You need commercial license when you want to "SELL" (not "bundle") SNDM. I assume most people prefer GPL and I don't want to receive lengthy legal documents to sign.<br>
<br>
Hope this answers to your message.<br>
