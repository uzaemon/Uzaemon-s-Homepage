<br>
For V5R2<br>
<br>
SYSIFCOPT(*IFS64IO) & DEFINE('_LARGE_FILES') seems to work.    Considering I do not know C it's a bloody miracle to get this far.<br>
<br>
<br>
On V5R2 compiling for V4R5<br>
<br>
DEFINE('__OS400__') seems to cause a problem, removing it appears not to affect the compiles but then the pgms cannot find any files when run :-(<br>
<br>
I'll keep trying but do feel free to chime in with any helpful comments!!!<br>
