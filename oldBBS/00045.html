Personally, I think people who want to use open-source software are considered to have comipler so that they can contribute to the society in future.<br>

> Is it possible to send me the objets ???<br>
<br>
Sorry but I can't send you the objects.<br>
<br>
- If I put program objects on my homepage, I'll be running out of server space.<br>
- I don't want to spend my time sending objects to people everytime I make changes to the software.<br>
- You should be very careful to use executables on the Internet. The object you get from somewhere may exec 'CLRLIB QSYS', 'PWRDWNSYS *IMMED', 'CHGUSRPRF QSECOFR..' or such.<br>
<br>
Please consider followings:<br>
<br>
- Buy ILE-C compiler.<br>
- Ask your friends or IBM to compile the distribution.<br>
- Use grace period of IBM software to compile the distribution. Contact IBM if it's OK to use the object after grace period.<br>
