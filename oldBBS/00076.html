> When using SNDM to produce an e-mail with an attached stream file, The stream file has unreadable data. Any ideas.<br>
<br>
If you have questions regarding SNDM, please clarify followings:<br>
<br>
- What version of SNDM are you using? (If you use 1.2x, you should use 1.31)<br>
- What is the version of your OS/400?<br>
- What kind of mail client are you using? Have you tried other mail clients?<br>
- Does this happen to all stream files, or only specific file?<br>
