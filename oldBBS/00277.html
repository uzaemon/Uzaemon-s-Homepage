<br>
Is there any way that I can get a compiled version of the two programs TIFFLIB and all it's objects and HPT and all it's objects?? I have a machine that has all the compilers I need... The problem is that I can't save it a a earlier release...  The machine I want it on is on V4R4..  :(   Can you help me out?? :)  Thanks...<br>
