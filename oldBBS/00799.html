Sorry for misunderstanding: I would have write SPL2STMF.<br>
<br>
The SPF2TIFF is the name of the corrected version that includes QWPJSN = '*CURRENT', QWPSCD = '*ONLY' and QWPSCT = ' ' to avoid some CPF33* messages.<br>
<br>
As I told you I tried to create a tiff using your original   SPL2STMF as downloaded from hpt.exe and I get this message:<br>
"Stream file generated sucessfully. execution time 0 min 1 sec, total pages = 1."<br>
<br>
TIFF2PDF works fine too (it says "TIFF2PDF completed successfully.")<br>
<br>
But when I open it with AR6 i get the warning .<br>
