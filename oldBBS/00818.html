Hi,<br>
I found the problem and I have the fix to avoid the message that AR6 must rebuild the document because it is damaged.<br>
I've also rewritten the entire tool using the latest tifflib version and more.<br>
If you are interested I can send you privately all the sources (FREE) and you can update your site.<br>
