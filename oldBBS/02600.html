Thank you for using SNDM.<br>

Here's my old post regarding your question.<br>

<br>
RFC 821 allows to send 1000 octets in one line. I limited the SNDM to allow only 80 bytes by following reasons.<br>
<br>
1. After some encodings, 80 characters would be translated to much longer string.<br>
<br>
2. Some mailers may unexpectedly fold the text line which exceeds about 80 characters.<br>
<br>
3. You can send any data as attachment file.<br>
<br>
On balance, 80 characters in one line is the safest value for most users in my opinion. If you really want to extend it by some reason which I cannot think of, you can modify the source code at your will.<br>
<br>

Hope this clarifies your question.<br>
