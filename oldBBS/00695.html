I tried TEXTJ(sample WSCST introduced at my homepage which converts SCS to plain text file), QWPDEFAULT, QWPHP5SI on my V5R2 system and always got CPF6DF8(Data cannot be transformed). Also, CPYSPLF refused to convert AFPDS to PF.<br>
<br>
As I have mentioned several times in this BBS, SPL2STMF is just a front-end to HPT API and I learned everything from IBM manuals and redbooks. Please ask IBM via your support channel if HPT has such capability.<br>
