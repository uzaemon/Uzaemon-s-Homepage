Hy I'm trying to change your source for supporting cirilic, all the secret is to translate from ccsid 1025 Or Job Ccsid, to the CCSID 1251.<br>
The question is : can i use iconv_index ?? I think you use it for handle many iconv() instances, because of the Open, convert,close sequence of this treatment.<br>
<br>
Another procedure that I must read carefully is QEncode, I think that I can use it without any change, I only need that the source string be a 1025 CCSID hexas stream.<br>
<br>
i'm mistaking something??<br>
<br>
Best Regards.<br>
