Anything is possible because we have the source code.<br>
<br>
However I'll not do that for CRTCSVF which is not for specific purpose, because I cannot come up with the good circumvention when a character field includes comma (,) character.<br>
<br>
What happens if a field (say, "address") includes comma? Do you have any idea?<br>
