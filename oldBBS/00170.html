Dear Sir,<br>
<br>
I would like to use cmd "SPL2STMF" on UZAEMON site.<br>
It was downloaded normality and I tried to compile RPG program "SPL2STMFRP". However, it is not created in our product environment (OS400:V4R4M0).<br>
I got following log message .<br>
Could you please give me advice ?<br>
<br>
Best regards,<br>
<br>
Mutoh.<br>
