> I'm interesting in obtaining a price for a license to use SNDM, SPL2STMF and TIF2PDF.  Please email me with specifics.<br>
<br>
Thank you for your interest.<br>
<br>
SNDM and SPL2STMF are subject to the dual-license which means you can use whichever you want.<br>
<br>
- You may use/modify/distribute SNDM and SPL2STMF under the terms of GNU GPL. GPL allows you to use the software without fee for commercial and non-commercial purpose.<br>
<br>
- You need commercial license only when you *sell* SNDM and/or SPL2STMF.<br>
<br>
TIFF2PDF is different, it should be distributed without fee.<br>
<br>
- TIFF2PDF is *not* covered by dual-license. It is free, open-sourced software. See 'license'(<a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/tifflib_license.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/tifflib_license.html</a>) for detail.<br>
<br>
If you really need commercial license for SNDM and SPL2STMF (in other words, you want to sell them), please send mail to uzaemon@my-Deja.com.<br>
