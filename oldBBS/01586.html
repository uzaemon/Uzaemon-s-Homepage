Below is a similar Q&A (dated 01/02/17!).<br>
Hope this answers to your question.<br>
<br>
-------------------------------------<br>
Q.<br>
I was using your SPL2STMF with much sucess to create tiff files then converting them to PDF. I then tried to greate .gif files using workstation customization object QWPGIF and the quality is much reduced? Are there any workstation customization objects out there that could be of better quality. (Also, I was wondering if colour would be supported in these transforms? Up until now I was only using black and white since I cannot generate an overlay from Windows is colour using the IBM AFP drivers they supply?)<br>
<br>
A.<br>
I tried it and got same result on V4R5. Image resolution of GIF file is much lower than TIFF (see <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/tiff_gif.png" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/tiff_gif.png</a> ).<br>
<br>
I think you have two options:<br>
<br>
- Ask IBM if QWPGIF can generate better image. As RTVWSCST is not available for QWPGIF, you need to ask IBM through your standard support process.<br>
<br>
- Convert TIFF to GIF. You can find some tools (for ANSI-C) on the Web, for example, check out <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~alberto/tiff/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~alberto/tiff/</a> , <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/</a> , <a href="http://kalex.engin.umich.edu/tif2gif/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://kalex.engin.umich.edu/tif2gif/</a> and many more.<br>
