<br>
You may create a small CL program which override STDOUT to (temporary) physical file before run MINIZIP. The PF will contain output from MINIZIP and you may examine the PF to check if the command was successful. Also specify '-o' option if you want to avoid file overwrite message.<br>
<br>
Of course you can modify the MINIZIP and create frontend CL program and command definition like TIFF2PDF.<br>
