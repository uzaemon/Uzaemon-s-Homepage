I have installed zlib121 on an i5 at V5R3. To be able to do the MAKE in QREXSRC I had to change __OS400__ to __iseries__. Actually it can be anything else since __OS400__ is a reserved name. I also had to rename BYFOUR to something like BY4.<br>
Also I had to comment out the second WRITEBUFFERSIZE in MINIZIP of H.<br>
Once all that was done, everything 'compiled' fine and everything ran well.<br>
Thanks<br>
Karl<br>
