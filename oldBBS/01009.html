Hi Uzaemon,<br>
I'm using the utility to convert Spool to Tiff and then to PDF. Everything is working fine, but when Pdf opens the document says "The file is damaged but is being repaired" and goes on. I've using last tools version from your site,<br>
my OS is V5R1M0, pcs with WindowsXP sp2, AcrobatReader 6 and 7 too.I've tried to do the same on V5R2M0 and V4R5M0 systems but the error still appear.<br>
Any idea on how it can be fixed to avoid this message ?<br>
I'll apreciate any help Thanks in advances.<br>
<br>
Luciano.<br>
