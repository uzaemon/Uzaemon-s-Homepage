<br>
No. As I use only one SMTP server in closed network, there are no need to relay mail.<br>

In your opinion, do I still need to implement all the quote/ (AUTH-LOGIN, AUTH PLAIN, AUTH CRAM-MD5, etc) /unquote or there could be some shortcut by using the os/400 user profile. I'm just thinking about SNDDST that acutally doesn't require any Account Authentication settings it also works with Allow mail relay = *NONE. So I suppose there is a way to allow some kind of "os/400 authentication"<br>

I don't fully understand your mail environment.<br>
<br>
If you use only OS/400 SMTP server with default configuration, I think you don't care about authentication.<br>
<br>
If you want to forward your mail from OS/400 SMTP server to, say, external SMTP server, you may need to allow relay to OS/400 SMTP server and allow external SMTP server to forward mail which comes from OS/400 SMTP server.<br>
<br>
If you want to send mail from external SMTP server (no OS/400 SMTP server), you should contact mail administrator and ask to allow relaying and disable authentication for your OS/400.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
