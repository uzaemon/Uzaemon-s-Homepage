It seems that the offending instruction is the<br>
/* stream-size object */<br>
<br>
I have a fixed version of your testprt.pdf that does not contain this section and opens without repair message even at AR 6. Do you have time to take a look at it ?<br>
<br>
It would be nice if we can fix the program.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
