If you need to pursue the problem, please send SNDM log file to uzaemon@my-Deja.com.<br>
<br>
SNDM creates spooled file when DEBUG(*YES) is specified. Run CPYSPLF to copy the spooled file to a physical file, then download the physical file to your PC in ASCII format using either FTP or Client Access.<br>

Waiting for your mail.<br>
