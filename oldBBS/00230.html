Sorry for my bad english, but I try to explain with a easy example (PrintScreen key press). I need your help.<br>
<br>
I need to retrieve a *Userascii Spools files into IFS files and after I send them to Fax board (I convert them from PCL format to TIF format), these spools are made into AS/400 by QUIKPRESS Software, a French Enterprise, and their format are *Userascii (graphics are included in them).<br>
I try to use your command, but I can't. I think that result is in EBCDIC code (into IFS file), and I should convert them to ASCII code, is it true?.<br>
<br>
Do you know how can I retrieve *Userascii spool files?<br>
<br>
Thanks for all.<br>
<br>
Regards,<br>
