Hi,<br>
the problem is solved, the reason was that de "from" address must exists in the local domain, if it don't exists, no external email can be sent.<br>
This is probably a setting of the email server.<br>
But it could be interresting for others people on the as400 community to know that ...  So, everybody knows it now :-)<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
Olivier<br>
