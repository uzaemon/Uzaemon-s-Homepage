Uzaemon,<br>
thank you for your answer.<br>
When you say in reply 979:<br>
My mail server does not require authentication<br>
<br>
Does it mean that you your SMTP server is set to Allow mail relay = *ALL?<br>
Changing this option seems to be the only way to allow SNDM work.<br>
<br>
If I only plan to use the iSeries SMTP server, how dificult is it to implement authentication? In your opinion, do I still need to implement all the quote/ (AUTH-LOGIN, AUTH PLAIN, AUTH CRAM-MD5, etc) /unquote or there could be some shortcut by using the os/400 user profile. I'm just thinking about SNDDST that acutally doesn't require any Account Authentication settings it also works with Allow mail relay = *NONE. So I suppose there is a way to allow some kind of "os/400 authentication"<br>
<br>
I just want to know what I'm getting myself into before I start.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
Boris<br>
