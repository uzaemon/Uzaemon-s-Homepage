> We use the SNDM command a lot. It does what we need. Now we see some Internet providers act different if a email address does not exist. There is 1 provider that accepts all email requests and if an email address does not exist it sends back the failing email with a note that the<br>
> address does not exist.<br>
> Another provider that gets a request to send an email checks the domainname interactively and let the command SNDM fail if a domainname does not exist.<br>

Please look into line 188 - 197 of SMTP/QRPGLESRC(#SEND) and modify according to your requirement. This part checks "SMTP negative response (other than 2xx, 3xx)".<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
