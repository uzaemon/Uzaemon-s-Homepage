Hy peter, my name is Nicolas.<br>
<br>
First you must change the CMD when it says<br>
PARM KWD(ATTACHMENT) .... MAX(5)<br>
by ...................... MAX(number < 30)<br>
<br>
and it could be all!!!<br>
Because the rpg program take care of the rest...<br>
<br>
Be aware of the limitacion of space, and attachments in the SMTP protocol.<br>
<br>
Best regards<br>
<br>

> The number had been determined by the limitation of CPP as described in help information. It depends on the total length of path name of attachment files. You have to determine length of path name and number of attachment files which does not exceed the limitation.<br>
