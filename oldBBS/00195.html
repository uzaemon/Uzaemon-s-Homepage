> I've got this error using SNDM. Do you have any ideas on what I can check. Message . . . . :   Command failed. reason -203 failed to connect remote server (connect(), 3425:A remote host refused an attempted connect operation.)<br>
<br>
<br>
The message indicates that the remote host (mail server) does not respond to TCP/IP socket connection request from your AS/400.<br>
<br>
Try followings and let me know the result:<br>
<br>
- Contact administrator of the mail server and confirm that the mail server is up and running to accept requests from TCP/IP hosts in your company.<br>
<br>
- Can you send a mail using other mail servers? (If you don't have alternative mail server, you can configure your AS/400 as mail server)<br>
<br>
- Can you send a mail using the same mail server from PC mailer (such as Outlook Express or Netscape Messenger)? PC and the AS/400 should reside in the same LAN segment.<br>
