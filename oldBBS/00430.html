As I stated at the top of this page, my BBS is not for general Q&A and your question is even too vague to answer. I recommed you to:<br>
<br>
- Search the Web. You can easily find how to configure your AS/400 as mail server, e.g. "Knowledge Base" (<a href="http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/slkbase.NSF/0cf528a492c9b4a88625680b0002037f/34879f5e413aa5cd8625697b0053f36a?OpenDocument" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://www-912.ibm.com/s_dir/slkbase.NSF/0cf528a492c9b4a88625680b0002037f/34879f5e413aa5cd8625697b0053f36a?OpenDocument</a>) or "Technical Studio" (<a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/tstudio/ebizv4r3/index101.htm" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/tstudio/ebizv4r3/index101.htm</a>) or "Information Center" (<a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/pubs/html/as400/v5r1/ic2924/info/rzair/rzairgetstart.htm" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/pubs/html/as400/v5r1/ic2924/info/rzair/rzairgetstart.htm</a>)<br>
- Post your question to French netnews or other BBS.<br>
- Contact your local support channel, if any.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
