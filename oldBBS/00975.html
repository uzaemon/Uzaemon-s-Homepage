Hello everyone,<br>
<br>
I had the same problem on our German i5, running V5R3. Could not compile due to a codepage conversion conflict (we do not have any DBCS codepages installed).<br>
<br>
Changing my JOB CCSID to 65535 fixed that, everything compiled fine. I am still wondering, though, where my iSeries picks up that codepage 5035? I cannot find it anywhere in/on the sourcefiles! Anyone has an idea?<br>
