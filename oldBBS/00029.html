The tif image is normal and fit the A4 paper.<br>

> I don't think you can convert *SCS to TIFF. First you need to exec 'OVRPRTF FILE(---) DEVTYPE(*AFPDS)' then produce AFP spool file (run compile, call print program, etc). Use WRKSPLF option-8 to confirm the spooled file has devtype-*AFPDS.<br>
<br>
I type the command OVRPRRT FILE(*PRTF) DEVTYPE(*AFPDS) and then<br>
WRKSYSSTS *PRINT to get the spool file. The spool file is normal and then I use the command SPL2STMF to convert it to .tiff image. Also,<br>
the .tif image is ok and NOT shink to small portion. After, I convert<br>
the .tif to pdf by TIFF2PDF and the problem occur.<br>
<br>
><br>
> >> 4. Did you specify WSCST(QWPTIFFG4) at SPL2STMF command? TIFF2PDF supports only TIFF-G4 format.<br>
> >  Yes. I convert the spool file to Tiff by wscst(QWPTIFFG4). But when I convert the .tiff file to .pdf, it shrink... What can I do then ??<br>

> If you display/print the spool file from AFP viewer (shipped with CA Express) or AFP printer, do you see correct output?<br>

> If above doesn't work, let me know exact procedure you are doing. I'll try the same thing using my AS/400.<br>
If you want to know what's problem with the pdf file. I can e-mail the file to your. Thanks for your help but I don't know what should I do then ?<br>
