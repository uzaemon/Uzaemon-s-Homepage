As a quick circumvention, edit MAKE procedure as follows. It worked on V5R3 machine (not mine).<br>
<br>
 0019.00 /* TGTRLS = '*CURRENT' */<br>
 0020.00 TGTRLS = 'V5R2M0'<br>
<br>
Or you may try Karl's circumvention described at message 904 in this BBS.<br>

Maybe... It seems like a bug or undocumented spec change.<br>
