Hello Jordi,<br>
<br>
> Can I create TIF file (Group 3) with SPL2SMTF command?.<br>
No, you can't. AFAIK, HPT doesn't generate G3 format TIFF.<br>
<br>
If you have ILE-C compiler, you are not out of luck. TIFFLIB<br>
contains TIFFCP program which converts a TIFF to another format.<br>
You can also see TIFF information using TIFFINFO/TIFFDUMP.<br>
<br>
Here's sample operation for you:<br>
<br>
| > SPL2STMF FILE(QPSUPRTF) TOSTMF('/tmp/g4.tif') WSCST(QWPTIFFG4)<br>
|   Stream file generated. execution time 0 min 2 sec, total pages = 14<br>
| > ADDLIBLE LIB(TIFFLIB) POSITION(*LAST)<br>
|   LIBRARY TIFFLIB ADDED TO LIBRARY LIST.<br>
| > CALL PGM(TIFFINFO) PARM('/tmp/g4.tif')<br>
| > CALL PGM(TIFFCP) PARM('-cg3' '/tmp/g4.tif' '/tmp/g3.tif')<br>
| > CALL PGM(TIFFINFO) PARM('/tmp/g3.tif')<br>
<br>
> I use GammaFax cards on Windows NT connected by Lan with AS/400...<br>
I don't know anything about GammaFax. Please contact GammaFax support<br>
person if G3 TIFF generated by TIFFCP can be sent using GammaFax.<br>
<br>
I ported TIFFCP/TIFFINFO just to confirm that TIFFLIB works on AS/400.<br>
I haven't fully tested those programs so I'm crossing fingers ;-)<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
