> I've installed the tiff2pdf program on the ibm as400 computer, and i'm unable to convert tiff to pdf - i get this massege "unknown field with tag 32934 (0X80a6) ignored". maybe you can help me fix this problem.<br>
<br>
What kind of TIFF are you trying to convert? You may use TIFFDUMP program to display the TIFF tag information.<br>
<br>
TIFF2PDF does not convert any TIFF to PDF. I ported TIFF2PDF just to convert multipage, black and white, G4 format TIFF because HPT function of OS/400 creates such TIFF when used with "QWPTIFFG4" WSCST.<br>
<br>
If you cannot convert TIFF which was generated by HPT, let me know how you created the file.<br>
