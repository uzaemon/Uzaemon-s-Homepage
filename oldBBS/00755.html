Hi,<br>
I downloaded the SPL2STMF utility. When I tried to use the command:<br>
<br>
SPL2STMF FILE(SPL2STMF) TOSTMF(test) WSCST(QWPCPQPM20) JOB(172309/USHANKA/QPADEV000R), it failed with the following error,<br>
Command failed. reason - API QwpzHostPrintTransform failed : CPF3CF2  hptopt = 20.<br>
When I checked QUSEC in debug, it had the following values:<br>
<br>
QUSBPRV OF QUSEC = 000000016.<br>
QUSBAVL OF QUSEC = 000000027.<br>
QUSEI OF QUSEC = 'CPF3CF2'<br>
QUSERVED OF QUSEC = '0'<br>
<br>
Is there anything I am missing? The reason why I tried to use this utility is that when I am sending a spool file via email, the page breaks and any control characters are missing. Alternately, is there any other way I could avoid the problem I am facing? Please advise.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Uday<br>
