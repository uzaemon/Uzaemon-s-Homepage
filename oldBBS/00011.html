Hello martin,<br>
<br>
> can you send me this file or update smtp120.exe<br>
<br>
Sorry but I've not been able to spare my time to translate HLP file from Japanese to English. Same applies to SPL2STMF and TIFF2PDF.<br>
<br>
I think those commands are straightforward but if you find any difficulties using those commands, please post question here.<br>
