Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
I make a spool file with AS/400 command:<br>
        OVRPRTF QSYSPRT DEVTYPE(*USERASCII)<br>
and after, I press Printscreen key. I try to view that spool file generated before but I can't (you can see 1* into spool pages section).<br>
<br>
Then, I use your command SPL2STMF, and I select *WSCST (QWPEPLPCL5). With my NT Explorer program, I go to path which where there is a test.pcl file generated by your command.<br>
<br>
I use "Page View" program to Lincoln Company for view a PCL file, then when I try to view it, I see a lot of @@@. Isn't a original PrintScreen made for me.<br>
<br>
Do you understand?<br>
<br>
An other option for make a *Userascii spool into the AS/400 is by LPR command from MSDOS/Windows PC. The object generated is an *Userascii spool (print to Document with bitmaps, etc) in one AS/400 OUTQ.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your fast request. I'm waiting for your news.<br>
<br>
