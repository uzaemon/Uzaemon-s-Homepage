Thank you for using SNDM.<br>
<br>
> I installed the command SNDM in our iseries V5R2 it's work fine but one thing important doesn't work : when the Recipient Mail address  doesn't exist i don't have any return message to say to me your have false address. i want to have return if the recipient mail address doesn't exist.<br>
> Is it possible to check Valid Recipient Mail address.<br>

It is not possible for most Internet mail client software (including SNDM) to check if a mail address is "valid". You can look for the Web to find the reason, e.g. <a href="http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.005_03/pod/perlfaq9.html#How-do-I-check-a-valid-mail-address" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://www.perldoc.com/perl5.005_03/pod/perlfaq9.html#How-do-I-check-a-valid-mail-address</a>- .<br>
