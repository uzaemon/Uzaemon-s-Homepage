Chuck,<br>
<br>
Thank you for using SNDM.<br>
<br>
> So I tried SNDM and it says it sent an email but I have yet to receive it. How/where do I check to see what is going on with this on the AS/400 ? I've looked and looked through all the TCP/IP stuff, etc, and cannot find anything.<br>
<br>
If SNDM complete successfully, it indicates that the SMTP server accepts request (send a mail) from SNDM. Then your SMTP server try to deliver your mail to the recipient(s).<br>
<br>
Please investigate followings and let me know what you find.<br>
<br>
1. Do you see any error message in SNDM debug output? (specify DEBUG(*YES))<br>
<br>
2. Are you using OS/400 as mail (SMTP/POP3) server? If so, can you send a mail to other OS/400 users (or yourself)?<br>
<br>
3. Can you send a mail using the same mail server from PC based mailers (such as Outlook Express or Netscape Messenger)?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
