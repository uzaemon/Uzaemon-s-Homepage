I contacted IBM, they said I should have two print files, 1 for printing and 1 for converting to TIF. This was not the resolution I was looking for. So I decided to keep working at it and after several hours I finally got the text to align with the overlay.  The overlay is defined in my PRTF, so I changed the positioning on the OVERLAY keyword to move the overlay to align with the text.<br>
<br>
A  R PRTOVL<br>
A                OVERLAY(OVLNAME .2 .25)<br>
<br>
<br>
  This allowed the transform to TIF to work correctly without causing the overlay to be misaligned when I printed the spooled file.<br>
