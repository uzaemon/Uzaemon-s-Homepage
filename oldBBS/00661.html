High!<br>
at first: thank you for your quick reply!<br>
<br>
Now to the problems:<br>
We are sending mails to our salesmen every day with up to 60 attachments. These attachments are very small (only 100 Bytes) and are located in only one directory per salesman.<br>
The attachments alre only links into an CRM-System, so the can easily lookup orders.<br>
We use today an PC-located mail-programm but our iseries (mod. 810 with V5R2M0) waits till the mail is send. Yesterday i've dicoverd your superb tool, which does the same job much quicker.<br>
<br>
Your hint to send serveral mails with max. 5 attachments may be useable, we will check, if we can change our iSeries-Pgm.<br>
<br>
Again: Thank you for your help!<br>

> I have four questions.<br>
><br>
> 1. First of all, why do you have to attach more than 5 attachment files? In my experience, I've never received a mail with so many attachment files.<br>
><br>
> 2. Why don't you use zip utility on iSeries (or AS/400)? By archiving attachement files, you can reduce the size and circumvent the file number limitation.<br>
><br>
> 3. Do you need to send such mail everyday? If acceptable, you can send two or three or four or more mails with 5 attachment files each.<br>
><br>
> 4. If you are running HTTP server, why don't you send a mail with links to the files? It's smarter and may reduce network traffic. Also, it's much more secure than normal SMTP/POP3 protocols when used with SSL and basic authentication.<br>
