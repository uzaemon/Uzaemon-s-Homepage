Please provide more information.<br>
<br>
- What is the version of your OS/400?<br>
- What version of SPL2STMF are you using?<br>
- Did you modify the source code?<br>
- Did you MAKE the utility by yourself?<br>
- If you have another AS/400, can you try to recreate your problem?<br>
- Does the problem occur to all (SCS and AFPDS) spooled files or only specific spooled file?<br>
- What happens if you use other IBM supplied WSCSTs?<br>
- What happens if you convert simple spooled file, say, created by "WRKSYSSTS *PRINT" command?<br>
- What do you see in the last part of debug print output of SPL2STMF command (specify DEBUG(*YES))?<br>
- Can you configure and use LPR or RMTOUTQ (specifying problematic spooled file and QWPTIFFG4) to invoke HPT?<br>
