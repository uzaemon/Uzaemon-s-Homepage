<br>
There are WSCSTs which convert SCS/AFPDS to PCL. Run "WRKOBJPDM LIB(QSYS) OBJ(QWPHP*) OBJTYPE(*WSCST)" and you can find more than 10 WSCST which support HP printers.<br>
<br>
If you are still not sure, try followings and open the output file with any PCL viewer.<br>

<br>
You can find a line similar to "DATASTREAM = HPPCL5" in your source.<br>
<br>
>   Then I appended a translation table for EBCDIC (CP=37) to ASCII (CP=437), in order to convert some not commonlly used character (ｬ) to <esc> (1B HEX). This way the printer knows the following report's data is PCL code, i.e.: ｬ&l2a1o1e88f0Lｬ*p0x0Yｬ&l1e8Dｬ(12Uｬ(s0p20h6v0s1b6Tｬ&k6Hｬ&l6.4C<br>
<br>
Those strings are simply translated from EBCDIC to ASCII by your WSCST and sent to HP printers. Only HP (or PCL-capable) printers can interpret the string as meaningful data.<br>
<br>
> I tried SPL2STMF using my WSCSTs and both QWPTIFFxx and the result is allways the same, I can read the escape codes as text, overlapped with report's data and overlay.<br>
<br>
Yes, of course. QWPTIFFxx is designed to convert SCS/AFPDS to TIFF (I assume). Your "escape codes" are neither of them so should be interpreted as plain text.<br>
<br>
Please read documents at <a href="http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/html/as400/v5r1/ic2924/info/rzahgicprinting.htm" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://publib.boulder.ibm.com/html/as400/v5r1/ic2924/info/rzahgicprinting.htm</a> to understand how HPT and WSCST works.  Also, see "296. Re^3: SPL2STMF (AFP to PCL/TIFF?)" again and take appropriate solution for you.<br>
