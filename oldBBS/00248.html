Hi,<br>
I am having a problem when executing the SNDM utility in batch mode this way:<br>
When, within a CL program CL1,  I call another CL program CL2 that itself invokes SNDM , SNDM works fine. However if the first CL program  does a SBMJOB of CL2 (instead of a CALL CL2). I get an error message. Have you already experienced this error while using SNDM and know what I am overlooking here?<br>
The error msg is as follows:<br>
Message . . . . :   Command failed. reason -135 invalid character found in<br>
  mail address description (FROM-[DOMINIQUE<br>
  DAHKOW@IBL.INTNET.MU])<br>
<br>
(This is the output of the dump)<br>
I cannot find any invalid character here and cannot understand why when called interactively, SNDM works file but when the CL that contains the SNDM call is submitted (same parameters, parm lengths etc), I get the above error.<br>
<br>
Any hint?<br>
<br>
Regards<br>
