Hello Bill,<br>
<br>
> Interested in the shareware software your offering...but i cannot read it.....characters are misinterpreted..  is it possible for you to repair the damaged site???/<br>
<br>
Most HTML pages except 'download' section in this site are wrtten in Japanese. If your browser doesn't display Japanese characters, you'll see gabage.<br>
<br>
Even in the 'download' section, SNDM documents have not been translated to English though SNDM itself should run fine in English(SBCS) environment.<br>
<br>
If you encounter any difficulty using my utils, please post your message here.<br>
