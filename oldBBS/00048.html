Hello,<br>
I tried your SMTP utility, for it is exactly what I am looking for.<br>
However, I can not succesfully run the 'MAKE' procedure, because the RPGLE sources contain '/COPY' lines, and the members in the '/COPY' are not available on my system. Can you help me?<br>
Maybe I only need the library QSYSINC?<br>
<br>
Kind Regards,<br>
Erwin Zwikstra<br>
