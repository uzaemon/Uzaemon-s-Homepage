Hi Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
Sorry if I didn't say to you what kind of solution I done about SPL2STMF with *USERASCII spools. I decided for your first solution, I'm using a WSCSCT named NONE. It was a good decision.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all, and sorry again.<br>
<br>
But I have a question for you:<br>
<br>
Is it possible to make a PCL with Chinese characters (Chinese traditional)?<br>
<br>
And is it possible to make a PCL code without Double byte (for HP Laserjet3 printer) for Chinese language ?<br>
<br>
I'm waiting for your news.<br>
<br>
Best regards.<br>
<br>
