Dear UZEAEMON,<br>
<br>
We are a software company in Germany with customers in the furniture and metal trade branches.<br>
We have tested your SNDM internally here in our company and we have seen that your SNDM can be easily incorporated into our software packages.<br>
We are considering encouraging our customers to also implement your SNDM.<br>
Could you please send us information about the use of your SNDM by our customers.<br>
How would you calculate the charges for their use?<br>
<br>
<br>
With kindly regards,<br>
<br>
Ulrike Roegle<br>
