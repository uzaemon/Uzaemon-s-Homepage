Thank you!<br>
I'll try your suggestions.  By the way I'm also going to be working on the AOL and Novell Groupwise Mail Client issues that have been identified earlier.  If I get them figured out, I'll let you know.<br>

> You can fix any issue regarding SNDM by yourself because you have source code (assuming that you have enough time and knowledge).<br>
