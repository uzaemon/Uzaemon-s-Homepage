<br>
First, you can request to send "message opened" mail to recipient by using "Disposition-Notification-To" header. For example, Outlook Express (5.5 or later, I guess) uses this field if the recipient has checked "Tool" -> "Option" -> "Receipts" tab -> "Request read receipt for all sent messages" checkbox. I suppose most users set this option to OFF to prevent sending unexpected mail (to spammers).<br>
<br>
Second. Normally, MTA (mail server) returns delivery failure message when it fails to send a mail to recipient. It is also possible to set a header to confirm delivery.<br>
<br>
Be warned that there is no reliable mechanism for Internet mail to confirm it to be delivered and opened.<br>
<br>
See RFC2298 (<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2298.txt" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2298.txt</a>), "2. Requesting Message Disposition Notifications" and RFC2821 (<a href="ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2821.txt" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">ftp://ftp.rfc-editor.org/in-notes/rfc2821.txt</a>), "4.4 Trace Information" for detail.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
