Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
have had a good look at pgm qcsrc(MINIZIP) and I think I have found a few possible errors (minor) in code (but could be my lack of C skills). Anyway, before I make any mods I thought it best to discuss and clear up these possible errors with you. It would be easier via email if you don't mind. I don't know your email address.<br>
