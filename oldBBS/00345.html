I'm sure this has to do with my inexperience with IFS.<br>
<br>
I am using outlook express as a client. Documents created on my PC and uploaded to IFS vis FTP work OK.<br>
<br>
I create the attachment by copying the file to IFS with CPYTOSTMF command. I can view the file with an FTP Client and it looks fine. In fact, if I cut and paste it from the VIEW feature of the FTP client and paste it into a a new document on my PC and upload that document to the IFS, that new document works.<br>
<br>
I must be doing something wrong with the CPYTOSTMF. For it I use:<br>
CPYTOSTMF FROMMBR('qsys.lib/mylib.lib/myfile.file/txt.mbr')<br>
 TOSTMF('/eml/abc.txt')<br>
 STMFOPT(*REPLACE) CVTDTA(*NONE)<br>
<br>
I have also tried CVTDTA(*AUTO)<br>
<br>
I don't know if it is important to note but I am using:<br>
<br>
Datebase file CCSID  . . . . . . > *DFTJOBCCSID<br>
<br>
as an option with SNDM.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help.<br>
