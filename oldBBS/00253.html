Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
thank you for your reply. I followed you instructions & looked at the debug information. Effectively, the parameters had 'garbage' information when the CL is submitted in batch. After looking at an As400 FAQ which explains issues when submitting jobs in batch and when parameters are > 32 in length, the problem is now solved. I have learned this lesson the hard way but the end-result is that the program is now working fine.<br>
Again, many thanks for this excellent SNDM utility.<br>
