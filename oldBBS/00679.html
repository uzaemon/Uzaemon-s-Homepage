<br>
Assuming that you are asking about mail body, quoted-printable is usually used for SBCS languages because the encoding scheme escapes only 8bit chars to "=XX" (XX is hexadecimal) representation, so that the mail is still readable even when your mailer does not support the encoding.<br>
<br>
BASE64 is mostly used to encode binary file (e.g.<br>
attachment file and inline image file) to safe text representation.<br>

See RFC1521 (obsoletes RFC1341). For more information, see related RFCs and other good documents which you can easily search and find on the Web.<br>
