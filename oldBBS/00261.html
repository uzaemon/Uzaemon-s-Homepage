I have not created the panel group yet as I'm busy working for other things. That compile-time error message has nothing to do with your problem because SPL2STMF should run without the panel group (command help).<br>
<br>
Have you examined the debug output? Didn't you find any message (such as "file opened" or so on) in it?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
