I didnt found a solution to the following problem (Alfred Adjei didnt answer to my mail):<br>
We use V4R4M0. We get the following Message:<br>
Command failed. reason -111 failed to initialize code conversion APi (CCSID 0000J->00819, 3021: The Argument for the value is not correct. We have CCSID 65535 and in the body_file information there is an Entry : File CCSID: -1<br>
The next Entry is File CCSID -1 may not valid, trying anyway.<br>
In Germany we have CCSID 65535.<br>
Whats wrong ?<br>
What CCSID should I use for the Source File ? Did I create a file from the source-File ?<br>
Thanks for your Help.<br>
Best Regards.<br>
Christian<br>
