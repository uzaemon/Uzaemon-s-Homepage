It looks like there are no need to update the port because I don't need those enhancements.<br>

Uzaemon,<br>

thanks for quick reply.<br>
The reason I asked was because of the following statement from zlib and the fact your port dates to 1999. I assumed then that the recent (feb 2002) winimage 0.18 port that you use would include the security fixes.<br>
<br>
from zlib site<br>
...."zlib 1.1.4 This version fixes a potential security problem, see details here. Any software that is linked against or derived from an earlier version of zlib should be upgraded immediately......."<br>
<br>

P.S. Do you see any problem calling MINIZIP with upto 75 file names (each max 128 bytes)? I'm planning on building it into some existing commands which handle this many IFS files.<br>
