Unfortunately, you need at least V3R7 (maybe.. I'm using V4R5) or later to compile SNDM as stated at my homepage. ILE-RPG compiler on V3R2 lacks many built-in functions (such as %EDITC, %LEN, %SCAN, %STR) used in the source members.<br>
<br>
I recommend to upgrade your AS/400 if you plan to add new application. According to 'OS/400 Software - OS/400 Release Support' (<a href="http://as400service.ibm.com/supporthome.nsf/document/17623433" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://as400service.ibm.com/supporthome.nsf/document/17623433</a>), V3R2 had been withdrawn at 05/31/00.<br>
