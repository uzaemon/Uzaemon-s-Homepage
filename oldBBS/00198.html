> What documents shoul I read to create a FTP Client,<br>
<br>
You should read FTP related RFCs (ex. <a href="http://www.wu-ftpd.org/rfc/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://www.wu-ftpd.org/rfc/</a>) on the net.<br>
<br>
If you are going to write the FTP client using ILE-RPG, go to <a href="http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://www.redbooks.ibm.com/</a> and look for redbook titled "Who Knew You Could Do That with RPG IV? A Sorcerer's Guide to System Access and More".<br>
<br>
I recommend to use Java because it is not an easy job to create FTP client and you can find some open-source Java based FTP clients on the net.<br>
<br>
> Another question, where I can get Information about licensing this utility<br>
<br>
If you are talking about SNDM, please read message "72.  Re: License price" in this BBS.<br>
