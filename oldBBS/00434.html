> Hi, I have downloaded and recompiled the Zlib library - RLS as V5R1M0 which is the current level of our operating system. But when I run the minizip program it fails - the joblog indicates an I/O error with file QAOKL02A in Qusrsys - I also notice that minizip has these files open for update ? Do you have any idea what may be wrong? Thank you, Reagrds, Ralph.<br>
<br>
I ran the make procedure on my 270(V5R1) and compressed a stream file in IFS (/tmp). Everything went well. I don't know why you encountered such strange problem because file QUSRSYS/QAOKL02A (base file is QAOKP02A) contains system distribution directory information and has nothing to do with ZLIB.<br>
<br>
Please check followings:<br>
<br>
1. Does your problem happen anytime you run MINIZIP?<br>
2. Does the problem occure to any stream files?<br>
3. Did you try to call MINIZIP by other user profile, e.g. QSECOFR?<br>
4. Does the file QUSRSYS/QAOKL02A exist?<br>
5. Do you perform system IPL every day?<br>
6. What ZLIB package are you using (downloaded from my site)?<br>
7. If you have other AS/400s, do you see the same problem?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
