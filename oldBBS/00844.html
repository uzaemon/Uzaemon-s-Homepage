First: I'm using cpysplf command to create a file. It is a simple text file, no control characters.<br>
<br>
second i'm using zip command to create a compressed file. this file appears to be OK because I can then extract the file back to it's original. I've also used MINIZIP in QShell interpretor and get the same results.<br>
<br>
Third I'm using FTP command on my PC, Binary Transfer, to get the file. I recieve the file ok, Winzip recoginizes the file and the file information displayed is correct.<br>
I use winzip 'TEST FILE' option and comes back 'FILE OK'.<br>
<br>
Fourth I attempt to unzip the file and that works, however the information is jibberish, nothing is recognizable from the original document.<br>
<br>
I can FTP the original file prior to compression and that file is OK. I don't use Binary Transfer for that however.<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
Mike<br>
