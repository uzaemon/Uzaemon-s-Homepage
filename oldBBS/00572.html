Hello, I currently have an AS400 V5R1M0 and I have loaded the SNDM command, this command works great most of the time, but I do have a problem that I hope you can help me with, We have a few french users who see OS/400 in French (we have Secondary Language 2928 French Loaded).<br>
But this always gives us the following error.<br>
 Command failed. reason -301 negative response from SMTP server ( RSPｰ501 Syntax error.  Special characters only permitted with escape character.｢#ｧ REQｰMAIL FROM:<DAVE.PAYN@TRIUMPH.CO.UK>｢#ｧ) can you help please.<br>
The system value QCCSID is set to 65535. We have no problems with English users who do not use the Secondary Language, they only use the base OS/400 2924<br>
<br>
Many thanks for any Help that you can provide<br>
