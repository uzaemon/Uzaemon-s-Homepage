You kindly supplied an executable *PGM for MINIZIP in your ZLIB download, which works. I need to be able to recompile it before making changes to the source, could you please advise me of the exact procedure you used to create the *PGM? When I try CRTBNDC the compiler can't find direct.h or io.h and complains that various functions are not prototyped. I'm running V4R5. Thanks in advance,<br>
<br>
