Something weird I just noticed, recompiling:<br>
<br>
It seems that on V4R2, the QZHBCGI *SRVPGM is in QTCP, whereas the QHTTPSRV library doesn't exist, and so the REXX script has to be altered accordingly.<br>
<br>
On V4R4 and later, the *SRVPGM is in QHTTPSRV, and NOT in QTCP.<br>
<br>
Yet the CL programs compiled under V4R2, and bound to the *SRVPGM in QTCP are somehow finding it in QHTTPSRV. Not being all that familiar with service program binding, I'm not entirely sure what to make of this.<br>
<br>
I'm also posting this query to MIDRANGE-L.<br>
