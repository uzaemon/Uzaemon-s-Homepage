Thank you for your mail. I looked into the TIF file "FATT5.TIF" and I think TIFF2PDF is working as expected.<br>
<br>
Size of "FATT5.TIF" is Width: 3968, Length: 3298 in pixel and there is "white space" area in right part of the file. You may use TIFFINFO program to confirm the information of the file.<br>
<br>
> ADDLIBLE LIB(TIFFLIB)<br>
  Library TIFFLIB added to library list.<br>
> CALL PGM(TIFFINFO) PARM('/tmp/fatt5.tif')<br>
<br>
  TIFF Directory at offset 0x1841e<br>
    Subfile Type: (0 = 0x0)<br>
    Image Width: 3968 Image Length: 3298<br>
    Resolution: 300, 300 pixels/inch<br>
    Bits/Sample: 1<br>
    Compression Scheme: CCITT Group 4<br>
    Photometric Interpretation: min-is-white<br>
    Orientation: row 0 top, col 0 lhs<br>
    Samples/Pixel: 1<br>
    Rows/Strip: 3298<br>
    Planar Configuration: single image plane<br>
  Press ENTER to end terminal session.<br>
<br>
TIFF2PDF scales the TIFF includeing the "white space", thus, you see small image in generated PDF file. See <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/tiff2pdf_scale.gif" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/tiff2pdf_scale.gif</a> for detail.<br>
<br>
Please confirm followings:<br>
<br>
- Why the "white space" exists? Is that what you specified by overlay, DDS keyword or printer file definition?<br>
<br>
- Try generating other image format, for example using QWPGIF. Does that also have same "white space" area?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
