Hi Uzaemons,<br>
<br>
Sorry if I didn't say to you what kind of solution I done.<br>
<br>
I decided for your first solution, I'm using a WSCSCT named NONE. It was a good decision.<br>
<br>
Thanks for all.<br>
<br>
But I have a question for you, very interesant:<br>
<br>
- Is it possible to make a PCL with Chinese characters (Chinese traditional)?<br>
<br>
I'm waiting for your news.<br>
<br>
Best regards.<br>
<br>
Jordi<br>
