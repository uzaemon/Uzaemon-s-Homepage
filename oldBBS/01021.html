>. . . I re-ported 1.2.3. Download the new file from <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/zlib123.exe" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/zlib123.exe</a> and see how it works. I don't have time to perform thorough test, so please let me know the result.<br>

Thanks. It's taking me a few steps to walk the library down to our only box with a fully operational C compiler (our V4R2 box), and as I recall, compilation is a bit troublesome, so it may be a while before I have any results.<br>
<br>
The ZLIB we have is the 1.2.1 version.<br>
<br>
And it's possible that the problem has nothing directly to do with ZLIB: maybe after a few hundred IFS file opens and closes, I'm hitting some sort of brick wall in the operating system, or maybe I have some sort of memory leak in my own code. At this point, I'm not ruling anything out.<br>
