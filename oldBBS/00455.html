Hi Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
FYI - re possible error:<br>
<br>
Member zlib/qcsrc minizip<br>
<br>
0248.00  zi.tmz_date.tm_sec  = zi.tmz_date.tm_min<br>
                             = zi.tmz_date.tm_hour =<br>
0249.00  zi.tmz_date.tm_mday = zi.tmz_date.tm_min<br>
                             = zi.tmz_date.tm_year = 0;<br>
<br>
I think the second zi.tmz_date.tm_min on stmt 0249.00<br>
should be          zi.tmz_date.tm_mon ??<br>
<br>
I have also being talking to Simon Coulter and he has a port of zlib which has been converted into a service program and wrappered into an os400 command and CPP. He has offered me a copy so I wont be proceeding with modifying minizip.<br>
