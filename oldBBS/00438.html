> I noticed it was based on version 0.15. Version 0.18 is now available and I was wondering if you planned to upgrade your OS/400 version to 0.18 ?<br>
<br>
I visited <a href="http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://www.winimage.com/zLibDll/unzip.html</a> and it states that "February 2002 : you can get version 0.18 with support of custom IO function for read/write zipfile, and raw reading in unzip/zip (for duplicate file from one zip to another without uncompress/compress)". It looks like there are no need to update the port because I don't need those enhancements.<br>
<br>
If I had time, I would port Info-ZIP (<a href="http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://www.info-zip.org/pub/infozip/</a>) because it is much more powerful than MINIZIP and MINIUNZ in functionality.<br>
<br>
Anyway, thank you very much for your information.<br>
