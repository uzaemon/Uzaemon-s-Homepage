I downloaded two savf : hpt and libtiff.<br>
<br>
From hpt I rewrote part of the SPF2TIFFR in order to fix some errors when using generic job name *  using the HostPrintTransform at V5r2 and to force the A4 format in parameter QWPPS1 (Paper source 1).<br>
<br>
(if you give me your mail I can send it and you can freely distribute it)<br>
<br>
Then I compiled with the MAKE rexx the libtiff programs and the spl2pdfc with 037, 280 and 65535.<br>
<br>
Btw if you have the utility working fine you can generate a<br>
PDF from a spool and send it to me and I can compare with mine (or I can send my PDF and you can compare, if you prefer).<br>
<br>
 This would allow to make sure that this is non a ccsid problem.<br>
<br>
This is the simple program I used to print a spool to test:<br>
<br>
Fqsysprt   o    f   80        printer<br>
C                   except<br>
C                   seton                                        lr<br>
Oqsysprt   e<br>
O                                              'BEPPE'<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
