> I'm using the utility to convert Spool to Tiff and then to PDF. Everything is working, but when Pdf opens the document says "The file is damaged but is being repaired" and goes on. I've checked the Xref offsets and seem ok.<br>

<br>
I have some questions.<br>
<br>
1. Did you make the utility by yourself?<br>
2. Do you see the message for all PDF file generated by SPL2STMF and TIFF2PDF?<br>
3. What is the version of your OS/400?<br>
4. What version of PDF reader are you using? Are you using only specific version of PDF reader (or viewer)?<br>
5. What is the primary (or execution environment) language of your OS/400.<br>
6. Which JOBCCSID are you using? If you create the PDF under JOBCCSID 65535, do you see any difference?<br>
<br>
Waiting for you reply.<br>
