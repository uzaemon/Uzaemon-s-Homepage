Hi, I like your SNDM utility, it is very easy to use and very effective. Good job. Would like to suggest if you could add "Authenticated SMTP" (i.e. UserID and Password to signon to the SMTP server before the email is relayed which is supported in the Java Mail API) to your utility. It will be great if you can do that, thanks.<br>
