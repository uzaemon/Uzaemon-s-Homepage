Dear Sirs,<br>
<br>
I have downloaded your SMTP program. I am however not able to compile the programs because of /copy members in the sources that I do not seem to have. Can you provide me with these /copy members, so I can compile the programs?<br>
Your program seems to be just what I have been looking for for quite some time now.<br>
Kind regards,<br>
<br>
