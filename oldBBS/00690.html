I installed the command SNDM in our iseries V5R2 it's work fine but one thing important doesn't work : when the Recipient Mail address  doesn't exist i don't have any return message to say to me your have false address. i want to have return if the recipient mail address doesn't exist.<br>
Is it possible to check Valid Recipient Mail address.<br>
if i send my mail and the name the addrress mail doesn't exist i want to know that like every web site.<br>
When you do classic sending mail and you get message return when the mail address doesn't exist in the WWW.<br>
Thanks in Advance<br>
