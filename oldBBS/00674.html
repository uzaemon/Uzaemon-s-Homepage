Hy, me and the Cyryllic isue Again.<br>
I change your code for Supporting Cyrillic, I use the ISO-8859-5 Charset Code, and the 1251 and 1025 CCSID's in the iconv routines.<br>
<br>
But I have a conceptual question, what is the diference between Quited-Printable and Base64??<br>
<br>
Is there any reation with the Charset of the mail.<br>
I know that i have to "write" the source of the mail in a Charset that a server could Undestand, but the Subject, and all the "data" of the mail should go in the other languaje , in this case Cyrillic.<br>
<br>
Now I'm going to change 2 things:<br>
1) Replace iso-8859-5 by Windows-1251, the las one is the default for windows boxes.<br>
2) Allow Content-Type: text/html; ,<br>
<br>
The 1) issue have nothing to do with 2), just for your info.<br>
<br>
So, where can I read soomething about Content-Transfer-Encoding:???<br>
<br>
Best Regards<br>
