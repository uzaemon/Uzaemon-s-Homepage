<br>
SNDM generates plain text mail, in other words, there are no way to specify font size.<br>
<br>
I don't know exact your requirement and environment, but you may consider followings:<br>
<br>
- Modify SNDM to generate HTML mail. See message "874. Re: SNDM: HTML Body" for more information.<br>
<br>
- Create PDF file (or any file which is capable to use small font) and send the file as attachment.<br>
<br>
- Ask mail recipients to view the mail using small font. This option depends on their MUA (Mail client software).<br>
<br>
- Prepare HTML page which uses small font and send only link to the HTML page using SNDM.<br>
