We use the SNDM command a lot. It does what we need. Now we see some Internet providers act different if a email address does not exist. There is 1 provider that accepts all email requests and if an email address does not exist it sends back the failing email with a note that the<br>
address does not exist.<br>
Another provider that gets a request to send an email checks the domainname interactively and let the command SNDM fail if a domainname does not exist.<br>
<br>
How do we catch a "301 negative response from SMTP server" during transmission of an email so it does not abord.<br>
<br>
Thanks, Peter<br>
