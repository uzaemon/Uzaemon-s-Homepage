Thank you for your quotation.<br>
<br>
> We're interested comercially your SNDM command.<br>
<br>
SNDM is subject to the dual-license which means you can use whichever you want.<br>
<br>
- You may use/modify/distribute SNDM under the terms of GNU GPL. GPL allows you to use the software without fee for commercial and non-commercial purpose.<br>
<br>
- You need commercial license only when you sell SNDM.<br>
<br>
> So, we're need price your SNDM command License.<br>
<br>
Currently I've not determined the price of SNDM. I assume most people prefer GPL and I don't want to receive lengthy legal documents to sign.<br>
<br>
If you really need commercial license, please send mail to uzaemon@my-Deja.com.<br>
