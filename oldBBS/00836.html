Hi<br>
<br>
I'm trying to use your tool but when I try to transform the spool on wich I have done an overlay (for printing it on a Laser printer) the tiff result not the same of the printed on the laser (I think that the problem is due to the fonts that are different)<br>
<br>
I hope my english is clear and I wait for your aswer<br>
<br>
Best Regards<br>
