<br>
Sorry,<br>
<br>
Yes, I was asking about RCVM.  I was in a hurry when I asked the question and didn't explain the problem very well.<br>
<br>
I seem to get the error when the "TO" part of the incoming emails contain more than one email address (such as an email list).<br>
<br>
I'll check the debug log and see what I can figure out.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your help<br>
<br>

> I can't figure out why you are asking above question. If you are talking about RCVM command, it can provides more debug information...<br>

> Anyway, it means length of String variable is smaller than the value. You can find more information about Java errors by searching Google.<br>
