<br>
SNDM is now only able to handle a PF with a recordlength of max 80 and a SRC-PF with a ecordlengths of max 92.<br>
Is it possible to send messages with a longer paragraph length than this ? (or a way to supress the CR-LF between two lines).<br>
Or has someone tried to change the programma so it accepts and handles longer recordlengths ?<br>
Thanks,<br>
