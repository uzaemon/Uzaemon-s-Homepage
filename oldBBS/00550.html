I've now been able to recompile with a new function that passes a negative windowBits (-15). But I'm still not able to produce a flate stream that works in PDF. The PDF works fine uncompressed. When compressing, I'm using a modified compress2 function that passes -15 to windowBits in deflateInit2 (other parameters set to default). I compress everything between stream and endstream, /Filter /FlateDecode is added and /Length is set to the length of compressed data between stream and endstream. Does anyone have an idea about what might be wrong? any help appriciated :)<br>
