> I have a problem using the SNDM command. Some firewalls reject our mails because the SNDM does not make a message-id. Is that correct? How can I solve the problem?<br>
<br>
I don't know why those firewalls reject your mail. You may configure your MTA (mail server) to append message-id header to the mail. As far as I know, sendmail automatically append message-id (if not exist) and qmail has setting for that purpose.<br>
<br>
Having that said, message-id header should be set by MUA (mail client, in this case, SNDM) according to RFC. You may modify SNDM to generate unique message-id.<br>
<br>
I'll modify SNDM when I have time but I'm currently so busy on my regular job...<br>
