I still cannot figure out your mail system configuration.<br>

<br>
Are are trying to send a mail from OS/400 (HQW400.PCNAIDCS.COM) to mail server at AUTUMNIX.COM via Domino server (PCNAIDCS.COM)? AUTUMNIX.COM seems to be rejecting relay mail (see message "318. Re: SNDDST works but SNDM does not?").<br>
<br>
Go back to my first question. Where did you see the error message? Is it content of returned mail? Apparently SNDM does not produce such lengthy message.<br>
<br>
> I used *LOCALHOST as mail server<br>
<br>
Second question. You are using OS/400 as mail (SMTP/POP3) server, right?<br>
<br>
> I can not setup Outlook Express (use our domino mail server) so I don't know it is work or not.<br>
<br>
Do you know anybody who can setup Outlook Express as mail client of your AS/400 mail server? The configuration task should take less than 10 min.<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
