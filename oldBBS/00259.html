<br>
The output file will be placed at the directory you specified in TOSTMF parameter. For instance, if you run the command as follows, you'll find the file "qpdspajb.txt" at directory "/tmp" on OS/400. Notice that the directory should present before you run SPL2STMF command.<br>
<br>
| > WRKACTJOB OUTPUT(*PRINT)<br>
| > SPL2STMF FILE(QPDSPAJB) TOSTMF('/tmp/qpdspajb.txt') WSCST(TEXTJ)<br>
|   Stream file generated. execution time 0 min 1 sec, total pages = 4<br>
<br>
Use WRKLNK OBJ('/tmp/*') or EDTF command to look for the output file.<br>
<br>

<br>
SPL2STMF does not directly generate PDF file. Please read the "usage" section of the utility again.<br>

<br>
You can specify DEBUG(*YES) for SPL2STMF and examine spooled file QPRINT to confirm the process of the command,<br>
<br>
Try above and let me know what you find.<br>
