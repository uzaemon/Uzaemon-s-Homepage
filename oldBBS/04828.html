> iï½´ve a problem with sndm in slowenia. Slowenia uses ISO-8859-2. I found on your hompage  <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/iso8859.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/iso8859.html</a> that you only support 8859-1 but the special characters in slowenia need the 8859-2. Can you say me how i can solve this problem please?<br>

Please understand that SNDM is working as designed.<br>
SNDM supports plain-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 and Japanese because I know how to handle those encodings in Internet mail. In other words, I don't know how to properly encode other languages such as Arabic, Chinese and ISO-8859-2.<br>
<br>
If ISO-8859-2 is just a simple variant of ISO-8859-1, you just edit a few lines of code. If not, you better look for other solutions (e.g. JavaMail).<br>
<br>
Hope this clarifies your problem.<br>
