uzaemon,<br>
<br>
thanks.<br>
<br>
I tried it with 1.000.000 which produces an other error..<br>
what is the limit?<br>
<br>
Other question: Is it possible to search within this BBS?<br>
And is it possible to possition to a discussion referenced by you?<br>
..it is heard to navigate form 700 to 89 by "previous..."<br>
<br>
thanks for all<br>
