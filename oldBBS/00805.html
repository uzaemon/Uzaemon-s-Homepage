Hi,<br>
<br>
I downloaded the new versions from your site and recompiled.<br>
<br>
The problem still persists also with your original "testprt.pdf" but only with Reader 6 (std english or italian doesn't matters).<br>
<br>
While the Reader 5 opens fine.<br>
<br>
I will try to investigate with Adobe (because I also have a fully licensed Acrobat Writer) to see if it is possible do diagnose our pdf and see what's wrong.<br>
<br>
Thanks for your time and your assistance.<br>
<br>
Beppe.<br>
