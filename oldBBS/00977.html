> I had the same problem on our German i5, running V5R3. Could not compile due to a codepage conversion conflict (we do not have any DBCS codepages installed).<br>
><br>
> Changing my JOB CCSID to 65535 fixed that, everything compiled fine. I am still wondering, though, where my iSeries picks up that codepage 5035? I cannot find it anywhere in/on the sourcefiles! Anyone has an idea?<br>
<br>
The only source of 5035 I think of is "LANGID", which can be confirmed by DSPFD command but cannot be specified in CRTSRCPF command. On my system, the value for "LANGID" is "JP".<br>
<br>
As I have only Japanese system, please try following procedure if possible:<br>
<br>
- RNMOBJ OBJ(SMTP/QRPGLESRC) OBJTYPE(*FILE) NEWOBJ(QRPGLESRCX)<br>
- CRTSRCPF FILE(SMTP/QRPGLESRC)<br>
- CPYF FROMFILE(SMTP/QRPGLESRCX) TOFILE(SMTP/QRPGLESRC) FROMMBR(*ALL) TOMBR(*FROMMBR) MBROPT(*REPLACE) FMTOPT(*NOCHK)<br>
- Change current library to SMTP and run MAKE procedure<br>
