I might give this a try when I get some spare time. I'm not a C programmer, but I've had a look at pgm and I think if I remove all stdout and stdin and return with a retcode everytime there is an error message I could turn it into a bindable module. I can then use callp from a CL program and turn it into a cmd.<br>
Anyway, I'll give it a try shortly and let you know how I get on<br>
