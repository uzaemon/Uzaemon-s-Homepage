In Japan, we set system value QUTCOFFSET to +09:00. When I send a mail using SNDM at 0AM, the date header is generated as follows:<br>
<br>
  Date: Sat, 11 Aug 2001 00:15:56 +0900<br>
<br>
Immediately, I did the same thing from Microsoft OutlookExpress.<br>
<br>
  Date: Sat, 11 Aug 2001 00:16:33 +0900<br>
<br>
From this experiment, I think SNDM is working well (as designed). Please describe your problem more detail (possibly with some examples) so that I can better understand your situation.<br>
