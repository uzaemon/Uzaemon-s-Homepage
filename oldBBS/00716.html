<br>
I have installed SNDM, and I want to thank you, because it's a very good tool to send emails.<br>
I have one problem when I try to send emails outside the domain of my company, could you tell me what I have to define so that it would work ?<br>
The command and the setup of the as400 system is OK for emails inside the domain.<br>
Thanks for any tip ...<br>
<br>
Olivier<br>
