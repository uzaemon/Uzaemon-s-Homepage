For binary distribution issue, please read message "45. Re: Convert tiff file to PDF file" in this BBS.<br>

<br>
What is your problem?<br>
<br>
If you are using V4R5 or V5R1, you can modify the "MAKE" procedure to specify TGTRLS(V4R4M0) for CRTBNDC, CRTPGM, CRTCMOD, CRTSRVPGM commands so that you can save objects for V4R4.<br>
<br>
If you are using V4R4 or earlier, you should be able to restore objects compiled on the release to V4R4.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
