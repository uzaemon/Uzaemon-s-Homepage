> Im very happy to tell you that i have installed your Counter 2.5 on our AS/400  and it works.<br>
<br>
I'm very happy to hear that wcount is working well on your AS/400.<br>
<br>
Also I appreciate your message at '146. Re^2: wcount parsing problem'. There are some difficulties handling variant characters such as '@' and '[' on AS/400.<br>
<br>
Thanks again and have a good weekend!<br>
