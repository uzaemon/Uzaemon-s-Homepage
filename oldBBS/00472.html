Hello uzaemon<br>
I just started to use SNDM quite a neat tool..<br>
Currently SNDM sends messages from a source physical file or PF.<br>
But i want SNDM to send message given as input (as in SENDMAIL utility if you know) or from an IFS instead of using a Source Physical file member .I went through the source it seems that it will take some time to digest the functionality.<br>
Would appreicate if you could take the time to give me a outline..<br>
Thanks very much<br>
Rizwan<br>
