Thank you very much for your help!<br>
Everything is now up and running. Our emails are created correctly.<br>
You are absolutely right with the problem of the line wrap but this sould be a quick solution for special needs.<br>
<br>
BTW: In your hints you have forgotten, that the member #PROC must be changed also because of the variable "ebcdic", which must be enlarged also.<br>
<br>
<br>
Thanks for your quick response.<br>
