<br>
I'm using SNDM with good success except for AOL users and attachments.  If I send a binary attachment such as a TIF image, the AOL user will not be able to open the attachment.  The AOL user can forward the email on to another email account and the attachment can be opened.<br>
<br>
Do you have any ideas?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
