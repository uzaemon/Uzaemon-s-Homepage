> Hello,<br>
> i tried to use the TIFF2PDF Tool but i always receive an error message: Filename: Can not read TIFF directory count.<br>
><br>
> How can i resolve this ??? I did everything which is mentioned in the docs but i donï½´t have the QFNT61 library... so left this parms blank....<br>
<br>
QFNT61 contains Japanese fonts and you don't need it unless you want to print Japanese characters. Instead, most western people use 5722SS1 option 8 "OS/400 - AFP Compatibility Fonts", I guess.<br>
<br>
Before you run TIFF2PDF, confirm that TIFF file has been created successfully.<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
