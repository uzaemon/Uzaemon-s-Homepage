<br>
I don't understand what you are asking... Do you want to convert *IPDS spooled file to PCL or Postscript by using SPL2STMF command?<br>
<br>
If so, please read message "168. Re: Re. *IPDS on AS/400" in this BBS. I tried the same on my V5R1 with latest cum and got same result.<br>
<br>
> OVRPRTF FILE(QPDSPSTS) DEVTYPE(*IPDS)<br>
> WRKSYSSTS OUTPUT(*PRINT)<br>
> ADDLIBLE LIB(HPT) POSITION(*LAST)<br>
  Library HPT added to library list.<br>
> SPL2STMF FILE(QPDSPSTS) TOSTMF('/tmp/qpdspsts.tif') WSCST(QWPHPLSR5)<br>
  Command failed. reason - API QwpzHostPrintTransform failed : CPF6DF8<br>
    hptopt = 30<br>
<br>
As far as I know, SPL2STMF (HPT) does not support conversion to Postscript. I recommend you to contact your support channel to search for other API or software product which meets your requirement.<br>
