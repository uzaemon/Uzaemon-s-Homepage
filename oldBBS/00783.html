Nikellis,<br>
<br>
Thank you for using SNDM.<br>
<br>
There are several ways to accomplish your requirement.<br>
<br>
1. Reduce size of CSV file<br>
<br>
I don't know what kind of tool you are using to create CSV file but you can reduce file size by following methods.<br>
<br>
- If you are using CPYTOIMPF command, try CRTCSVF command (you can find it at my homepage) which generates much smaller CSV file.<br>
- Use ZIP for OS/400 (also available at my HP) to compress CSV file.<br>
<br>
2. Run FTP or HTTP server on your OS/400<br>
<br>
If your OS/400 (on which CSV files reside) is accessible from mail users via TCP/IP protocol, configure FTP/HTTP server. For mail users to download CSV file, send link shown below:<br>
<br>
- For FTP server, link format to the file will be something like "<a href="ftp://(user):(password)@(FQDN)/(path)" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">ftp://(user):(password)@(FQDN)/(path)</a>".<br>
- For HTTP server, link format to the file will be something like "<a href="http://(FQDN)/(path)" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://(FQDN)/(path)</a>".<br>
<br>
See RFC 1630 and 1738 for more detail. You might able to use "<a href="file:///" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">file:///</a>" if you configure NetServer (SMB server) on your OS/400.<br>
<br>
3. Others<br>
<br>
Investigate "iSeries Access for Web" because it has many nifty functions, e.g. users can create specific SQL request and download data as Excel format.<br>
<br>
For better security, you should create CGI program which sends CSV file directly as HTTP response via secure connection (such as https).<br>
<br>
I hope this answers to your question.<br>
