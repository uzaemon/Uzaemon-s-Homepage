It works. I make some changes in the program, and It support 1025 to 1251.<br>
<br>

<br>
Yes, I'm reading, RFC1345, and I believe that I must Use ISO-8859-5 to handle Cyrillic, but how did you code Qencode for translating un asterisc (*) into =2A ??.<br>
In the RFC the Character table said that:<br>
*      002a    ASTERISK<br>
<br>
and that:<br>
E!     00c8    LATIN CAPITAL LETTER E WITH GRAVE<br>
<br>
And that exactly what I see, but what do I have to do if I need:<br>
A=     0410    CYRILLIC CAPITAL LETTER A<br>
<br>
What must be write to the mime file, " =A= " ??<br>
<br>
