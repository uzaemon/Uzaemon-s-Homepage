Below is message 89:<br>
<br>
| > I get the following error when I try the SPL2STMF command:<br>
| > "Fatal error : API QwpzHostPrintTransform failed : CPF6DF9 hptopt = 30"<br>
|<br>
| According to DSPMSGD command, CPF6DF9 indicates:<br>
|<br>
| Message . . . . :   Transformed data buffer too small.<br>
| Cause . . . . . :   The transformed data buffer of &2 bytes<br>
| is too small to hold the &1 bytes of transformed data that<br>
| is available.  Only &2 bytes of data have been copied to the<br>
| transformed data buffer.  The remaining transformed data is lost.<br>
|<br>
| That means you should increase buffer size (200,000)<br>
| which is defined at line 57 and 233. You can try DEBUG(*YES)<br>
| to determine the buffer size.<br>
<br>
Hope this circumvention works as before.<br>
