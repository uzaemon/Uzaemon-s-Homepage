I'm using the ZLib serviceprogram, and need to set a different value for windowBits in deflateInit2_ in order to get a deflate stream without header and trailer. The compress/compress2 function in the serviceprogram uses the default value only. Has anyone made a new serviceprogram with a compress function that takes this (windowBits) as a parameter? I'm not able to this myself since our AS/400 doesn't have a C compiler installed..<br>
