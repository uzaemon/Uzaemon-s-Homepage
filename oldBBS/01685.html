> I using your tiff2pdf 3.4, I recompile on O/S 5.4 AND i use your HPT 0.04 for create TIFF file.I Don't make any change on your TIFF2PDF. I wrote JVMs because I DON'T KNOW your utility and i don't Know that api use, I AM NOT  VERY expert.   I open PDF FILE WHITH ACROBAT READER 5.0, 6.0 AND 7.0 and all program produce same error.<br>
