Hello uzaemon!<br>
<br>
At first i would like to thank you again that you created the tool SNDM! It is very usefull four me and my company!<br>
<br>
I just want to inform you, that it is possible to create an email with 199 smal attachments!<br>
I modified the sourcecode (CMD and SNDM-RPG) anf tested it with 199 attachments. Each attachment has a name with around 32 characters, so that i currently need a cmd-length that is around 7000 bytes and only these 199 attachments needs 6000 byte.<br>
<br>
In the RPG only the line "Dattachment_num   C                   199" was changed.<br>
In the CMD only the qty. of attachments was set to 199.<br>
<br>
So - thanks again for your tool!<br>
<br>
BTW: We work with an exchange server 5.5 and SNDM send the mail direct to the server (Parm SMTPHOST in cmd SMTP)<br>
<br>
