As stated at "usage" section (<a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/sndm_usage.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/sndm_usage.html</a>), SNDM supports plain ASCII, Japanese (ISO-2022-JP) and ISO-8859-1 as mail header and body. Languages supported by ISO-8859-1 are listed at <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/iso8859.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/iso8859.html</a> and I don't think Cyrillic is on the list.<br>
<br>
On the other hand, you can use any language in attachment file regardless of CCSID of the stream file because SNDM treats it as a binary stream.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
