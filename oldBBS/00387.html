Thanks for your help !<br>
Sorry, I didn't express the problem clear. I can use this utility but if the spooled file have "chinese word", I can't find these "chinese word" in TIFF file. The TIFF file only have numbers, letters character and some Japanese word.<br>
<br>
* What is the version of your OS/400?<br>

  VERSION 0-03 00-03-18<br>
* Did you modify the source code?<br>
  NO<br>
* Did you MAKE the utility by yourself?<br>
  No<br>
* If you have another AS/400, can you try to create your<br>
  problem?<br>
  No<br>
* Does the problem occur to all (SCS and AFPDS) spooled<br>
  files or only specific spooled file?<br>
  Only specific spooled file (with "tradition chinese"<br>
  word)<br>
* What kind of WSCST are you using? IBM supplied QWPTIFFG4<br>
  or anything else?<br>
  QWPTIFFG4<br>
* What happens if you convert simple spooled file, say,<br>
  created by "WRKSYSSTS *PRINT" command?<br>
  WORKS<br>
* What do you see in the last part of debug print output<br>
  of SPL2STMF command (specify DEBUG(*YES))?<br>
