> I have been testing SNDDST in batch and interactively and has worked OK.  However, I have tried to do this with my overnight back up and have not been receiving email from the job.  I shutdown the subsystems QSNADS, QSERVER and QSYSWRK and I don't know if this is affecting the SNDDST command.  Then I found your utility SNDM and I wondered if this would overcome this problem by writing directly to the SMTP server.  Does this utility in terms of subsystems and AS400 services running?<br>
<br>
SNDM just requires TCP/IP connection between the mail srever. It does not rely on any IBM-supplied subsystems.<br>
<br>
Please try and let me know the result.<br>
