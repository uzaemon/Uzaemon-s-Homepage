Many thanks for the answer.<br>
I have a great confusion.<br>
On my AS/400 System I have installed:<br>
- an HPT library<br>
- a TIFFLIB Library<br>
SPL2STMF command is put in HPT Library and I think it's used by the CVTSPLFPDF tool.<br>
<br>
This is a tool that I have downloaded form the Internet.<br>
I don't know who is the author.<br>
<br>
The error is this:<br>
when I have to convert a spool file with size more 80-100 pages, the pdf conversion doen't function but it's only created a TIFF file on the IFS.<br>
<br>
What do you think ?<br>
Do you know HPT Library ?<br>
My OS/400 release is V5R2M0<br>
