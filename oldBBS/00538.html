<br>
Because:<br>
<br>
- Self-extracting "exe" file is more convenient for most people. More than 96% of total access to this site use WIN32 platform.<br>
<br>
- You can create your own "zip" version of distribution because the programs are GPLed.<br>
<br>
- WIN32 platforms (95, 98, 98SE, ME, NT, 2000, XP) are virtually available at almost anywhere.<br>
<br>
Does this answer to your question?<br>
