Hi,<br>
we made OVL using IBMs newest AFP drivers WITH color images.<br>
The result was fine using IBMs AFPViewer. But if we try to use this OVL in a PrinterFile as AFPDS-Overlay the results<br>
ar only black areas - in all cases at paper and also in a tiff.<br>
What's about color printing?<br>
Note: We have absolutely no problems with b/w-overlays, whether in OVLs nor in TIFFs or PDFs.<br>
Thanks for your answer.<br>
<br>
