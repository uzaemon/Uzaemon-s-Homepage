Hello Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
I'm having a little trouble getting your SPL2STMF command to work on my system.  The CPF333B error "Job system name is not valid." comes up but I'm not sure how to resolve it.  I've read the BBS entries from Trevor, and it appeared that you changed the SPL2STMF tool to handle V5R2 but it still doesn't work properly on my machine.  Can you point me in the right direction?<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance,<br>
Tim<br>
