Do you mean french people cannot input ';' from their 5250 terminal (codepage 297, I assume)?<br>

Double quote is necessary to canonical CSV file (IMHO) so I don't have a plan to add a function to "disable the option doublequote" for now. However you can create your own CRTCSVF by yourself as I stated in previous message "217. Re: output file with CRTCSVF".<br>
<br>
For example, you may change the default value of  variable "quote" in line 182 of CSV/SOURCE(CRTCSVF) to space (X'40'). Or change to control character (such as X'01') and remove the character before write to output stream file. Remember to comment out line 760 ~ 773 to avoid side effect.<br>
