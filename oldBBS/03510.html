What kind of "size" error you've encountered?<br>
Without knowing detail of the error, it's impossible to guide you to solve the problem...<br>
<br>
I don't know anything about CVTSPLFPDF.<br>
Is that a command you created? If not, have you contacted the author for solution?<br>
<br>
-----------<br>
<br>
There are size limitations in my utilities.<br>
<br>
- SPL2STMF (though you didn't mention) has 16MB limitation for now. I designed the program to use single USRSPC. If you want to convert large spool file, you may need to modify the program to cope with multiple USRSPCs.<br>
<br>
- The maximum file size of tifflib and TIFF2PDF depends on the type of file system you are using and type of variables used in C functions. Usually, 2GB is the maximum size in traditional 16 bit implementation.<br>
