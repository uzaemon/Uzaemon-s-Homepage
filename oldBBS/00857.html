<br>
Thank you for your feedback. Name of attachment-file is defined by following RFCs.<br>
<br>
- RFC 2183 (Content-Dispositon field)<br>
- RFC 2045 (definition of parameter, value)<br>
- RFC 2231 (non-ASCII, parameter longer or equal than 78 byte)<br>
<br>
In reality, few MUA (Mail client software) supports RFC 2231, instead, they use other encodings (ex. MIME or clear text). So I have not determined RCVM should implement this.<br>
<br>
For now, it is safe to use only ASCII characters as attachment-file name.<br>
