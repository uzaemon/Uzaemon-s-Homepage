J'am just asking about suggestions how to make the changes in the quickest, easiest way, in which module? which place? I'am not so experienced with RPG, maybe the best way for me will be to modify any existing part of program, but please help me with Your experience.<br>

We use 870 code page in EBSDIC and 1250 ANSI Windows code. The best is to use translation table in SMTP parameters, but... it do not work. Can You help me with any suggestions?<br>
