<br>
I'm not sure about your problem. Please explain your problem in detail and confirm followings.<br>
<br>
- For plain text and other PC file types (e.g. .exe or .xls), SNDM works fine, right?<br>
<br>
- How did run SNDM command? Please enumurate all parameters.<br>
<br>
- What kind of mail client are you using? Does the problem happen on any mail client (e.g. Outlook Express, Netscape Messenger)?<br>
<br>
- What is the version of your OS/400 and SNDM?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
