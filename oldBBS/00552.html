> Do you have AS400 utility to convert a AS400 document in one of folders from AFP format to TIFF or any other graphic format.<br>
<br>
Unfortunately, there are no such utility in this site. I don't know how you created AFP file in folder, but if you can print the file by some means, you can use SPL2STMF to convert to TIFF file.<br>
