Thanks, that did help some. I had the developer get rid of special symbols in the attachment name and it is working now.<br>

The joblog shows RTNCDE = 8 "Cannot save part" and rcvmdebug.txt shows java.io.IOException: Error in encoded stream, got 3. I am pretty new to Java, does this like a problem with the attachment in the email or a problem with RCVMAIL class? We are at OS400 V5R2M0 and pretty current on PTF Cum and Java Group PTF's.<br>
