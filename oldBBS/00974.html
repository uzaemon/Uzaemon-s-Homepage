In my understanding, it is possible to use GPLed software for commercial use.<br>
There are some issues regarding "dynamically links". I don't think programs<br>
which call SNDM are not "derivative work". For more information, refer to<br>
<a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL</a>, for instance.<br>
<br>
SNDM is subject to the dual-license which means you can use whichever you want.<br>
You need commercial license when you want to "SELL" SNDM. I assume most<br>
people prefer GPL and I don't want to receive lengthy legal documents to sign.<br>
<br>
> I prefer to walk the proper way!<br>
So it depends. If you are planning to use SNDM just for your commercial application,<br>
you can use SNDM under GPL.<br>
