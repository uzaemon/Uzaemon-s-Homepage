<br>
We have on our AS/400 set the system value to QUTCOOSET on "+1". This is correctly, there we are in Germany (MET).<br>
Your program CDATE uses this system value about the program QWCCVTDT.<br>
If email is generated has this in the head a wrong date. The time then by an hour is moved.<br>
Must we change your SourceFile CDATE or what can we do?<br>
<br>
With best regards Johannes Bley<br>
