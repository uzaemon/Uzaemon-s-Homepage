>> 1. Is the TIFF file generated properly? Use Microsoft Imaging or any other image tool to check the TIFF image.<br>
> I've check the image and the size is normal(A4).<br>
<br>
So doesn't the image shrink to small portion in bottom left corner when you display full image?<br>
<br>
>> 2. What version of OS/400 are you using? Older OS/400 (say, V4R2 or before) has may PTFs for HPT(Host Print Transform).<br>

<br>
If the TIFF image is normal, no, you don't need PTF.<br>
<br>
>> 3. Does this happen to all AFP spool files? If you convert, for example WRKSYSSTS *PRINT, do you still see the same problem?<br>

<br>
I don't think you can convert *SCS to TIFF. First you need to exec 'OVRPRTF FILE(---) DEVTYPE(*AFPDS)' then produce AFP spool file (run compile, call print program, etc). Use WRKSPLF option-8 to confirm the spooled file has devtype-*AFPDS.<br>
<br>
>> 4. Did you specify WSCST(QWPTIFFG4) at SPL2STMF command? TIFF2PDF supports only TIFF-G4 format.<br>
>  Yes. I convert the spool file to Tiff by wscst(QWPTIFFG4). But when I convert the .tiff file to .pdf, it shrink... What can I do then ??<br>
<br>
If you display/print the spool file from AFP viewer (shipped with CA Express) or AFP printer, do you see correct output?<br>
<br>
If above doesn't work, let me know exact procedure you are doing. I'll try the same thing using my AS/400.<br>
