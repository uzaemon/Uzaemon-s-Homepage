> But we need to have more then 5 attachments - is ther a way to change this. I've tried to look into the sourcecode but i can't find the trick.<br>

The number had been determined by the limitation of CPP as described in help information. It depends on the total length of path name of attachment files. You have to determine length of path name and number of attachment files which does not exceed the limitation.<br>

Recently I'm very busy on my regular business and cannot spare much time on this. Please look into source code and post what you don't understand in this BBS (somebody may answer to your question... I hope).<br>
