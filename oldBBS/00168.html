<br>
I tried to convert *IPDS spooled file to stream file using some WSCSTs as follows without success on my V4R5.<br>
<br>
> OVRPRTF FILE(QPDSPSTS) DEVTYPE(*IPDS)<br>
> WRKSYSSTS OUTPUT(*PRINT)<br>
> ADDLIBLE LIB(HPT) POSITION(*LAST)<br>
  Library HPT added to library list.<br>
> SPL2STMF FILE(QPDSPSTS) TOSTMF('/tmp/qpdspsts.tif') WSCST(QWPTIFFG4)<br>
  Command failed. reason - API QwpzHostPrintTransform failed : CPF6DF8<br>
    hptopt = 30<br>
<br>
Message ID CPF6DF8 indicates that the transform program does not exist for data stream. Detail ability of HPT is not documented, so you may contact your support channel to clarify the specification of HPT.<br>
<br>
As I'm not a developer in Rochester Lab, I don't know if they have a plan to support *IPDS. I hope next release of OS/400 provides more printer streams and WSCSTs support.<br>
