Yes, the utilities could function. But it's necessary the C compiler on the AS400 in order to make the programs. Is it possible to found a savf with all the programs compiled in V4R3 or previous ?<br>
<br>
Thank you<br>

> "htp_520.exe"has been saved specifying V4R5 as target release. If you are using V5R2 (with latest PTF level), you need to use "htp_520.exe". "hpt_510.exe" has been saved specifying V3R2 as target release.<br>
