Hi,<br>
I'm using the utility to convert Spool to Tiff and then to PDF. Everything is working, but when Pdf opens the document says "The file is damaged but is being repaired" and goes on. I've checked the Xref offsets and seem ok.<br>
Any idea on how it can be fixed to avoid this message ?<br>
Thanks.<br>
Beppe<br>
