I have been doing some testing of how minizip behaves in batch mode and it seems to cause a few problems.<br>
1. no return code/message mechanism<br>
2. uses fprint when in batch mode (ends up in qprint)<br>
3. may use scanf for prompt input in batch mode (this actually causes big problems by filling up the spool file)<br>
<br>
So, my question is do you have any suggestions for running this in batch mode? Maybe some of the other readers have got around this (made modifications etc)?<br>
<br>
