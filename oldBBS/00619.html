Hi again, maybe my mistake was that after reading the RFC1345, I thought that SNDM use Ciryllic.<br>
<br>
Where canI read more of these RFC, and how can I implement that on your SNDM utility??<br>
<br>
Onother about CRTCSVF, do you plan to add a Command Parameter called "DECIMAL SEPARATOR", in some windows box Excel uses coma(,) as decimal separator, but in other it can use dot(.), it depends on the languaje of windows, in our case could be English, or Spanish.<br>
<br>
Best regards<br>

> As stated at "usage" section (<a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/sndm_usage.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/sndm_usage.html</a>), SNDM supports plain ASCII, Japanese (ISO-2022-JP) and ISO-8859-1 as mail header and body. Languages supported by ISO-8859-1 are listed at <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/iso8859.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/iso8859.html</a> and I don't think Cyrillic is on the list.<br>
><br>
> On the other hand, you can use any language in attachment file regardless of CCSID of the stream file because SNDM treats it as a binary stream.<br>
