> I download your utility CRTCSVF from your site but when the REX pgm try to compile the source the RPGLE CRTCSVFRPG make errors. For exemple the line D/COPY QSYSINC/QRPGLESRC,QUSEC because in my AS (ver 5.1)  the lib QSYSINS does not exist.<br>
<br>
You have to install QSYSINC as I stated at my homepage ("! Read before you start !").<br>
<br>
See messages "268. Re: SNDM: Problem running STRREXPRC SRCMBR(MAKE) ", "159. Re: SNDM compilation problem", "129. Re: Library QSYSINC", "109. Re: CRTCSVFRPG compiling error", "66. Re: /COPY" and "49. Re: SMTP" in this BBS for more information.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
