> Curently we are developing further and want to crate a simple email with delivery notifications. For some reasons we want to send a printerfile as mailbody. Do do this efectively we need to use longer textlines in the mail body than 80.<br>
> I have bben searching the source code - but i cant find the trick to get longer textlines. Could you please give me a hint in which module i haver to do some changes.<br>
<br>
I don't recommend the modification because if the recipient forward the mail, body text may be wrapped unexpectedly.<br>
<br>
Still, if you need to do that, you may check out following source members:<br>
<br>
- line 443 of member #GEN -> read from body file<br>
- line 202 of member #INIT -> check text length<br>
- several lines of member SNDM -> receive buffer definitions<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
