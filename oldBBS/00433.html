Hi, I have downloaded and recompiled the Zlib library - RLS as V5R1M0 which is the current level of our operating system. But when I run the minizip program it fails - the joblog indicates an I/O error with file QAOKL02A in Qusrsys - I also notice that minizip has these files open for update ? Do you have any idea what may be wrong? Thank you, Reagrds, Ralph.<br>
