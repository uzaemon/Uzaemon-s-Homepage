> I'm using 1-33 of SNDM and V4R2. The data in the attachment text file from the IFS is being converted to garbage. This will be great when I can figure this out. The attachment is a simple text file named SZ.TXT in the EML directory. I specify /eml/sz.txt as the attachment.<br>
<br>
I have a few questions :<br>
<br>
- How did you create "sz.txt"? Can you open the file (via Netserver or FTP) by Notepad or any text editor on Windows?<br>
<br>
- What kind of mail client are you using? Does the problem happen on any mail client (e.g. Outlook Express, Netscape Messenger)? (See message "307. Re^3: Attachment Files (SNDM)")<br>
<br>
- If you send other file (e.g. Excel worksheet or PC binary file) as attachment, do they also become unusable?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
