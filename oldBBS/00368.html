I have found and fixed the problem w/ AOL clients not being able to download attachments.  I have also tested this w/ Novell clients as well.<br>
<br>
The problem is in the #GEN section where the "boundary" is built.  The string should have no spaces  ie..<br>
<br>
Current version outputs like this  boundary = '--Next_Part'<br>
<br>
It should be   boundary='--Next_Part'<br>
<br>
I have changed my version and it works quite well.<br>
<br>
