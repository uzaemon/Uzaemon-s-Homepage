Uday,<br>

> I downloaded the SNDM utility. I think it works great. Thanks for that. I got one question. Is there a way to confirm if the message was sent succesfully out of the AS/400? It would be very helpful if you could answer my question.<br>
<br>
If SNDM completes without error, the mail has been accepted by your SMTP server successfully. There are no common method to check if the mail arrive to the recipient(s).<br>
<br>
See message "379. Re^3: How can i be sure that the email was sent ?" (<a href="http://hpmboard1.nifty.com/cgi-bin/thread.cgi?user_id=MXA02134&disp_no=379&log_no=379&msg_per_page=50&def=10" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://hpmboard1.nifty.com/cgi-bin/thread.cgi?user_id=MXA02134&disp_no=379&log_no=379&msg_per_page=50&def=10</a>) if you want to check the completion status of SNDM.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
