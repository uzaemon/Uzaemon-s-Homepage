> I'm trying to use your tool but when I try to transform the spool on wich I have done an overlay (for printing it on a Laser printer) the tiff result not the same of the printed on the laser (I think that the problem is due to the fonts that are different)<br>
<br>
I suspect that your problem is in OS/400(HPT API). As SPL2STMF is just a front-end to HPT API, please ask IBM via your support channel when HPT doesn't work as expected.<br>
<br>
Before contact your support, I recommend you to consider followings :<br>
<br>
- apply latest Cum and HPT-related PTFs.<br>
- if you have an access to another AS/400 or iSeries, run the same thing and see what happens. Or you may ask your business partner or friend to recreate your problem.<br>
- if the problem occurs only for the specific spooled file, look for the difference.<br>
- prepare the procedure to recreate your problem using OS/400 functions which use HPT, e.g. RMTOUTQ, LPR, Access for Web, etc.<br>
- contact your support channel to ask IBM to investigate (and fix) the problem.<br>
