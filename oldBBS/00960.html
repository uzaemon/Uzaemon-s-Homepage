> Which field(s) should be changed from 32767 to 65535 so that the buffer would be doubled?  These are all the references to 32767 that I found.<br>
<br>
I made simple modification and <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/CRTCSVF_65535.txt" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/CRTCSVF_65535.txt</a> is output from CMPPFM command. I confirmed it to work until 178th field under V5R3. If you need more, use user space instead of char variable.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
