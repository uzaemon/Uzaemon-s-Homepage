<br>
You should check out character code check/conversion statements such as,<br>
<br>
member "#INIT" -> line 54-55, line 79-82, line 93-99<br>
member "#PROC" -> line 171-172, line 196-204<br>
member "#GEN" -> line 40-45, line 70-75, line 216-221, line 249-254, line 478-480, line 556-558<br>
member "USER" -> variable "a_c" and "a_x"<br>
<br>
Furthermore, SNDM uses both BSD socket APIs and OS/400 unique APIs. See <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/SNDM_flowchart.gif" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/SNDM_flowchart.gif</a> for detail.<br>

> I'am not so experienced with RPG, maybe the best way for me will be to modify any existing part of program, but please help me with Your experience.<br>
<br>
Sending canonical Internet mail is not so easy. I recommend you to consult Internet Mail/ILE-RPG/socket programming expert.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
