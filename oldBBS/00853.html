> We are getting this error only on emails sent from a utility running on one of our WINDOWS 2003 servers. The joblog shows RTNCDE = 8 "Cannot save part" and rcvmdebug.txt shows java.io.IOException: Error in encoded stream, got 3. I am pretty new to Java, does this like a problem with the attachment in the email or a problem with RCVMAIL class? We are at OS400 V5R2M0 and pretty current on PTF Cum and Java Group PTF's.<br>

Your problem looks similar to "784. RCVM dreate directory" (<a href="http://hpmboard1.nifty.com/cgi-bin/thread.cgi?user_id=MXA02134&disp_no=784&log_no=784&msg_per_page=50&def=10" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://hpmboard1.nifty.com/cgi-bin/thread.cgi?user_id=MXA02134&disp_no=784&log_no=784&msg_per_page=50&def=10</a>). Please read the article and reinvestigate your problem.<br>
