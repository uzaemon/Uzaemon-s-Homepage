Peter,<br>
<br>
I have four questions.<br>
<br>
1. First of all, why do you have to attach more than 5 attachment files? In my experience, I've never received a mail with so many attachment files.<br>
<br>
2. Why don't you use zip utility on iSeries (or AS/400)? By archiving attachement files, you can reduce the size and circumvent the file number limitation.<br>
<br>
3. Do you need to send such mail everyday? If acceptable, you can send two or three or four or more mails with 5 attachment files each.<br>
<br>
4. If you are running HTTP server, why don't you send a mail with links to the files? It's smarter and may reduce network traffic. Also, it's much more secure than normal SMTP/POP3 protocols when used with SSL and basic authentication.<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
