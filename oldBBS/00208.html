Joe,<br>
<br>
Thank you for using CRTCSVF.<br>

<br>
No, I have been using the utility since V3R7 (now, CRTCSVF is working well on V5R1).<br>

<br>
Frankly, I cannot determine your problem from only this information.<br>
<br>
- How are you looking for the stream file, by WRKLNK command or NetServer or FTP or anything else?<br>
- Did you modify the program?<br>
- Did you rebuild the program?<br>
- Are you using latest version?<br>
- Do you have any special characters in the stream file name?<br>
- Can you create CSV file in IBM supplied directory such as '/tmp' or '/home'?<br>
<br>
Let me know the result of your investigation.<br>
