I created a command for minizip with the replace option, zip to file name & zip from file name as parms, and then I just call the command on the command line & filled in the prompts.  There was no errors.  The new file has the zip extention at the end, but when I looked at the file sizes of the original and zipped file thru Windows Explorer, they were the same, and the ratio was zero for the zipped file when I tried to open it, and I could read the data when I opened it.  That was what made me believe the file wasn't compressed at all.<br>
