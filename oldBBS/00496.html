I think they are correct. But I have a question. If I use AS/400 as SMTP gateway (no mail server, only gateway to route an e-mail to mail server) is the same that AS/400 is the local SMTP server? Maybe I use SndM wrongly?<br>
Remote SMTP server is Windows (Microsoft Exchange).<br>
<br>
> - What is the version and PTF level of your OS/400?<br>
V4R5M0 MF27767<br>
<br>
> - What happens if you change line 16 of SMTP/QREXSRC.MAKE from "OPTION = 0" to "OPTION = 1" and recompile the distribution.<br>
The situation is the same.<br>
A question: why I don't compile source with ccsid(870). Before compiling, I need change job ccsid to 65535.<br>
<br>
> - If you have another AS/400, do you encounter the same slow-down?<br>
Yes.<br>
<br>
> - Does the slow-down occurs always, or occasionally?<br>
Always.<br>
<br>
> - If the slow-down always happens, please run the SNDM twice and send two debug logs to my mail address.<br>
I sent logs.<br>
<br>

> I'm not sure but I believe most AS/400 shops use SNDM without such phenomenon, so this problem may be specific to your AS/400 system.<br>
I think so, that problem is specific for me. I have not enough knowledge about tpc/ip, smtp, e-mail, so I'm not sure, that my use of Sndm is correct.<br>
