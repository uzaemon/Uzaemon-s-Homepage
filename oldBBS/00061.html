John,<br>
<br>
>  I seem to have trouble with the sndm when i am sending attachments. The body text no longer appears in the email. If I perform the same sndm with no attachments then the body text apears no problems. We are running V4R4. Any help appreciated.<br>
<br>
Please confirm followings,<br>
<br>
- What kind of mail client are you using? Does this happen to any mail client (e.g. Outlook Express, Netscape Messenger)?<br>
<br>
- If you use SNDM version 1.2, try newer verson from <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/smtp130.exe" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/smtp130.exe</a> .<br>
<br>
- If above doesn't work, please send SNDM log file (spooled file) and mail temporary file (in temporary directory) to uzaemon@my-Deja.com.<br>
SNDM creates spooled file when DEBUG(*YES) is specified. Run CPYSPLF to copy the spooled file to a physical file, then download the physical file to your PC in ASCII format using either FTP or Client Access.<br>
Also, SNDM leaves mail temporary work file in temporary directory if DEBUG(*YES) was specified. See online help for details.<br>
<br>
Waiting for your mail.<br>
