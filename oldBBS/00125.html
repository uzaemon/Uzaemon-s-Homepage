I was using your SPL2STMF with much sucess to create tiff files then converting them to PDF. I then tried to greate .gif files using workstation customization object QWPGIF and the quality is much reduced? Are there any workstation customization objects out there that could be of better quality. (Also, I was wondering if colour would be supported in these transforms? Up until now I was only using black and white since I cannot generate an overlay from Windows is colour using the IBM AFP drivers they supply?)<br>
