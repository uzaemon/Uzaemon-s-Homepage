Just to let others know...I had some troubles getting SNDM to work with attachments with Groupwise clients.  I had seen the previous posts reading the boundary= issue but that didn't help with my problem...Groupwise just wasn't seeing the attachments.<br>
<br>
What finally worked for me was to add a CRLF at the end of the boundary statement.  So the line in #GEN looked like:<br>
<br>
EVAL      tmpfwb = 'Content-Type: multipart/mixed; ' +<br>
               'boundary="' + boundary + '"' + CRLF<br>
<br>
And now it works perfect!!<br>
