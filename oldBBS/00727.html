Uday,<br>
<br>
> I got another question about SNDM utility. If we typed a wrong email address but in the right format (for example 123@345.com), though there is no CPF message generated at the time of using SNDM, the sender keeps getting the Delivery failure email from the Mail router. Infact, when I was testing the SNDM utility and entered a wrong recepient email address, I(as a sender) am getting delivery failure emails for the last 2-3 days, saying that the message is delayed and it is going to keep trying. Is there a way we could limit these emails/trials to a particular number?<br>
<br>
There are no way for SNDM (and any MUAs) to limit such error-reply-mail. You should consult your mail server administrator (or ISP).<br>
