Hi Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
First of all, thanks a lot for the SNDM command. We've been using it for years now.<br>
One question; I've made some programs which create an "on-the-fly" SNDM command which is executed afterwards.<br>
This morning it crashed because the SNDM command reached the maximum of 30 recipients.<br>
I was wondering if my version of the SNDM command is old, and if perhaps this maximum is higher now.<br>
<br>
Thanx<br>
