Bob,<br>
<br>
> with 300.000 same problem appears to me: CPF24B4<br>
<br>
CPF24B4 indicates "Severe error while addressing parameter list." I suspect that your problem is in OS/400(HPT API). I recommend you to consider followings :<br>
<br>
- apply latest Cum and HPT-related PTFs.<br>
- there is no logical reason but just try to recompile SPL2STMF with lower optimization option.<br>
- if you have an access to another AS/400 or iSeries, run the same thing and see what happens. Or you may ask your business partner or friend to recreate your problem.<br>
- if the problem occurs only for the specific spooled file, look for the difference.<br>
- prepare the procedure to recreate your problem using OS/400 functions which use HPT, e.g. RMTOUTQ, LPR, Access for Web, Host on Demand, etc.<br>
- contact your support channel to ask IBM to investigate (and fix) the problem.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
