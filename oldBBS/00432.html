It is impossible to help you unless you provide adequate and accurate information.<br>
<br>
First, please reread and answer to my previous questions(message "425. Re: Send file not format text with SNDM").<br>
<br>
Second, run the SNDM command specifying DEBUG(*YES) and send debug print output (convert spooled file to PC text format. There are lots of ways to do that) to my mail address.<br>
<br>
I will investigate them (answer to my questions and debug print output) and come back to you.<br>
