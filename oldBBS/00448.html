I recommend you to contanct your support channel to confirm actual specification of CPP.<br>
<br>
For your information, here's what I think of.<br>
<br>
If files you want to ZIP can be placed in the same directory, you don't need to specify full path name, but just file name. By doing so, you can change the length (128) shorter.<br>
<br>
Or it might be possible to use qshell interpreter to call MINIZIP by creating symlnk to the program. I don't know the length limitation of qshell but it may worth to try.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
