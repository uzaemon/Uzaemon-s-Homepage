<br>
Yes, you are correct.<br>
<br>
For limitation 1 (100 fields), it can be doubled by increasing buffer size from 32767 to 65535. For limitation 2, you may use QSHELL cat command to concat stream files, for example,<br>
<br>
> cat /tmp/a.csv<br>
  1st a.csv<br>
  2nd b.csv<br>
  $<br>
> cat /tmp/b.csv<br>
  3rd b.csv<br>
  4th b.csv<br>
  $<br>
> touch -C 819 /tmp/c.csv<br>
  $<br>
> cat /tmp/a.csv /tmp/b.csv > /tmp/c.csv<br>
  $<br>
> cat /tmp/c.csv<br>
  1st a.csv<br>
  2nd b.csv<br>
  3rd b.csv<br>
  4th b.csv<br>
  $<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
