I assume that you've set "check mail message every (less than 10) min" in mail client property setting.<br>
<br>
To determine your problem, consider followings and let me know the result of your investigation:<br>
<br>
1. Do you see the same problem by sending a mail by other mail clients? (SNDDST, OutlookExpress, Netscape Messenger, Lotus Nots, etc.)<br>
<br>
2. If you can use another mail server, does it still takes long time to receive a mail?<br>
<br>
3. Are you sending a large mail (or attachments)?<br>
<br>
4. In the mail header, you can check when mail gateway received the mail as follows. Does any of the gateway takes long time to forward the mail?<br>

<br>
5. Most mail server software has the capability to log the traffic. Is it possible to contact your mail server administrator (or support channel) to identify the problem?<br>
