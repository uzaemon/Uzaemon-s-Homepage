Hello Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
   First of all i'd like to thank and congratulate you for the fantastic SNDM utility of yours.<br>
<br>
   The reason i'm writing this message is the following...<br>
When i'm using an AS/400 text file as the mail body of the SNDM command and writing some web links there (http://...), everything works perfectly in my Lotus Notes or Outlook express. I'm using SNDM through a CL program that converts AS/400 files to .csv format and mail them to the users. This CL program is running after the update of some output AS/400 files directly from users without my involment. The problem is that my users are practically don't care for the size of their attachments...The results might be for example an e-mail of 15Mb size...<br>
<br>
   I'm thinking of using again SNDM, but this time with links to my network. I can transfer As/400 program's outfiles (with .CSV format) to the local network, but i'm having troubles to create the links...<br>
For example:<br>
"F:/Files/kostas/outfile.csv" is of course not recognized as a link from Lotus Notes 5.01 or Outlook express 6.<br>
I have tried several different ways (i even tried with html commands, even if i have read here that the SNDM body file can only be plain text.<br>
For example "<a href="file:///files/kostas/outfile.csv" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">file:///files/kostas/outfile.csv</a>", or with the domain name after the "<a href="file:///" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">file:///</a>" and then the whole path, but...<br>
<br>
   I understand that this is not an SNDM problem, but if you can suggest something i'd really appreciate.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>
<br>
<br>
Kind regards<br>
<br>
