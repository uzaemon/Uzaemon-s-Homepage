Hello Uzaemon!<br>
<br>
This was a hard one!<br>
<br>
But I found out, that after changing the CCSID to 65535 everything could be compiled correctly.<br>
<br>
But I don't realy know if the country and character specifications was the problem because I have copied the sourcefiles to a new QRPGLESRC and H and LICENSE and QREXSRC with the ccsid 65535 and language id ENU.<br>
<br>
Now everytinh is O.K. - as far as I have tested.<br>
<br>
