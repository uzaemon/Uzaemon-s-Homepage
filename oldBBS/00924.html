Hello uzaemon<br>
<br>
Thanks for the quick Replay<br>
<br>
It's indeed a user defined WSCST.<br>
1) Indeed SCS to PCL5<br>
2) Yes (tested it with QWPDEFAULT)<br>
3) No surely not on all spoolfiles ... for now, only on this example (a spoolfile of 767 pages)<br>
<br>
But I've changed now the program (see also other message I send:<br>
<br>
Possible solution:<br>
added code:<br>
C Eval QSPLPC = 'Y'<br>
in subroutine: #HPT<br>
Between line 361 and line 362<br>
<br>
Now it doesn't crash anymore<br>
and the results looks OK<br>
<br>
But I'm of course not sure of it's allright what I'm doing now.<br>
<br>
Kind Regards,<br>
Stijn<br>
