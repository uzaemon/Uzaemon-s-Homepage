CCSID 65535 indicates the contents is not tagged to any language thus no conversion will take place.<br>
<br>
Have you read a message "272.  Re^3: SNDM: failed to initialize code conversion"? If so, you should know that there are circumventions.<br>
<br>
1. Specify DBFCCSID(*DFTJOBCCSID) or DBFCCSID(valid EBCDIC CCSID).<br>
2. Create source physical file with vaild CCSID (not 65535) and specify the file for FILE parameter.<br>
<br>
In German, I assume that you are using 273 as default job CCSID.<br>
<br>
Try them and let me know the result.<br>
