Stijn,<br>
<br>
I have some questions.<br>
<br>
1. What is "LEXOPTRAN"? Is this a WSCST you created? If so, how do you want to convert? (e.g. SCS to PCL)<br>
2. Does this problem happen with IBM supplied WSCSTs?<br>
3. Does this problem happen on any spooled files? (Try to convert WRKACTJOB *PRINT, for example.)<br>
<br>
Message CPF3CF2 means:<br>
<br>
Message . . . . :   Error(s) occurred during running of &1 API.<br>
Cause . . . . . :   Call your service organization and report the problem.<br>
  Materials to accompany the problem are:<br>
    -- Job log of the failing API.<br>
    -- Actual parameters specified on the API.<br>
<br>
As user-defined WSCST is not supported by IBM, you'd better try other WSCSTs in QSYS.<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
