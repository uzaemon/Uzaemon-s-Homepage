Hi Uzaemon<br>
I'm writing to you on SPL2STMF problem. The command work very well when I make the convert from AFP to TIFF, but my fax server don't like it. My fax server (Zetafax) expand the image, so the result is the fax pages with only half image.<br>
I try to convert from AFP to GIF, and Zetafax like it very much, but when my AFP document is more lenght then 1 page, SPL2STMF only create an image GIF with the first page.<br>
<br>
Could you help me?<br>
<br>
I'm also using TIFF2PDF and SNDM and both are working very well.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much from Italy.<br>
Bye<br>
