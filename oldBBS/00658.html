Hello!<br>
<br>
The tool SNDM ist very usefull - we want to use it in our production enviroment!<br>
<br>
But we need to have more then 5 attachments - is ther a way to change this. I've tried to look into the sourcecode but i can't find the trick.<br>
<br>
Pleas give me a hint - maybe per mail?<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
Peter Feickert<br>
