> i USE YOUR TOOL HPT/TIFF2PDF on OS 5.2 and all right, but I change my as/400 and I istalled OS 5.4 with JVM 1.3 default and 1.4,the tiff file is all right, but when with TIFF2PDF I CREATE a PDF the last file not open whith acrobat reader 7. Acrobat reader error is:<br>
> FIND UNKNOW TOKEN: '594,580527'<br>
<br>
I have several questions.<br>
<br>
- First of all, what versino of TIFF2PDF are you using? Did you recompile the utility on V5R4 by yourself?<br>
- How do you create TIFF file? Are you using my SPL2STMF utility?<br>
- Did you make any change to the original TIFF2PDF?<br>
- Why you mention JVMs? TIFF2PDF and SPL2STMF are written in ILE-RPG and ILE-C.<br>
- Can you open the PDF file by using older acrobat readers (3.x, 4.x, 5.x or 6.x)?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
