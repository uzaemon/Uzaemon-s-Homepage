Hi<br>
could you please explain in my view 2 contredicting statements:<br>
1. The one that is placed at the top of the main web page:<br>
"All of the programs found here run on IBM AS/400 and iSeries. They are open-source and free for personal and commercial use."<br>
2. The second is found in the license description of the SNDM program:<br>
- If you sell software based on SNDM, you need commercial license<br>
<br>
So my quesion is, what is the procedure for using the SNDM program commercially?<br>
Thanks.<br>
