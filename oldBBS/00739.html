It is a real pleasure to use this tool, because it is (nearly) perfect - that's my real opinion.<br>
But for special solutions some enhancements must be applied - as we solve for example the problems with the attachments.<br>
<br>
Curently we are developing further and want to crate a simple email with delivery notifications. For some reasons we want to send a printerfile as mailbody. Do do this efectively we need to use longer textlines in the mail body than 80.<br>
I have bben searching the source code - but i cant find the trick to get longer textlines. Could you please give me a hint in which module i haver to do some changes.<br>
<br>
Thanks in advance.<br>
