I'm on hold on getting it to work.  I have one AS400 which has a C and RPG compiler on it. I have a second machine with AFP installed and the fonts.  The first machine is on V4R5 and the second is on V4R4.  I have a mix match...  I'm upgrading my second machine from V4R4 to V4R5 so that I can bing back the compiled vesion's.  I want to be able to convert AFP's to PDF's..   I tried what you have said and it seems to be great.. I just have to wait and see if I can get it work with AFP's...<br>
<br>
Thanks<br>
Chris<br>
