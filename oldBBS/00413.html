> I use SNDM to send the mail to user inside the network, it is working. But I can not send the mail to the person outside the network. It give me error distribution to user identifier *UNKNOWN *ANYMAIL failed. Can you help?<br>
<br>
Please investigate followings and let me know what you find.<br>
<br>
- Where did you see the error message? SNDM should return more informative message with error code.<br>
<br>
- Are you using OS/400 as mail (SMTP/POP3) server?<br>
<br>
- Can you send mail to outside your network using the same mail server from PC based mailers (such as Outlook Express or Netscape Messenger)?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
