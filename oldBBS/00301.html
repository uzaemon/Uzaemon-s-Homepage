In fact, I think these aren't PCL WSCSTs, they're HPT WSCSTs. I retrieved the sources for these WSCSTs using:<br>
    RTVWSCST DEVTYPE(*TRANSFORM)<br>
        MFRTYPMDL(*HP5SI)<br>
        SRCMBR(HP5SI)<br>
        SRCFILE(PRTFLIB/QTXTSRC)<br>
        TEXT('Modified WSCST for HPLJ 5Si printer')<br>
<br>
  Then I appended a translation table for EBCDIC (CP=37) to ASCII (CP=437), in order to convert some not commonlly used character (ｬ) to <esc> (1B HEX). This way the printer knows the following report's data is PCL code, i.e.: ｬ&l2a1o1e88f0Lｬ*p0x0Yｬ&l1e8Dｬ(12Uｬ(s0p20h6v0s1b6Tｬ&k6Hｬ&l6.4C<br>
<br>
My printers are PC attached and AS/400 emulated with Rally! (an AS/400's device emulator like CA) or Lan printers using HP JetDirect ethernet adapters.<br>
<br>
I tried SPL2STMF using my WSCSTs and both QWPTIFFxx and the result is allways the same, I can read the escape codes as text, overlapped with report's data and overlay.<br>
<br>
I'm using AFPDS device type, with OVRPRTF .. DEVTYPE(*AFPDS) .. , to print overlays.<br>
