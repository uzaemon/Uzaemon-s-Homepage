So you typed your mail account instead of "stucchi" and actual password for the account insterad of "xyz", right? And you still see error message?<br>
<br>
I'm not sure if JavaMail accept IP address as mail(POP3)server name, so please try both (IP address and IP host name). F.Y.I I always use host name ("pop3.nifty.com", for exapmle).<br>
