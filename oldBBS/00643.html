Two questions.<br>
<br>
1. Without modification to RCVM, were you able to receive mail(s) using another account (less than 10 chars)?<br>
<br>
2. Please describe exactly how and which lines of codes did you modify?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
<br>
P.S. Please use "reply" link instead of creating new thread because it's easier to follow.<br>
