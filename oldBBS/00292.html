Hi Uzaemon,<br>
<br>
> > 3. When I use PCL escape secuences those commands are not converted, and I can read them as a part of the data. Some time ago I created WSCSTs to print reports with escape secuences in HP printers if I use any of these customizing objects the TIFF file generated is 'Invalid file or type not supported'.<br>
><br>
> I don't understand what you want to do. Are you trying to create a TIFF file using WSCST for PCL data stream?<br>
><br>
-----------------------------------------------------<br>
<br>
Before I used SPL2STMF I created several WSCSTs where I changed some HEX codes to translate the escape code to ｬ, the following is an example of my escape codes: ｬ&l2a1o1e88f0Lｬ*p0x0Yｬ&l1e8Dｬ(12Uｬ(s0p20h6v0s1b6Tｬ&k6Hｬ&l6.4C<br>
<br>
I'm using these WSCSTs to print formatted reports (with overlays and escape secuences) in diferent HP printers such as models 4, 5M, 5Si, 8000, 1100 and 1200.<br>
<br>
SPL2STMF don't converts these codes so I can see them in the image, overlapped with the data of the report.<br>
<br>
What I want to do is, using SPL2STMF, convert this formatted reports to TIFF to send them via e-mail; I know TIF2PDF (or STMF2PDF?) could be usefull, but many of aour contacts don't have Acrobat Reader nor any other tool to view PDFs.<br>
