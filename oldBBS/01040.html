Thanks for developing such a great utility like SNDM.<br>
<br>
Anyway, I wish to know if it is possible to send out attachment other than in:<br>
<br>
"Content-Type: application/octet-stream"<br>
<br>
type.<br>
<br>
because unfortunately this creates problem with some EDI procedures that doesn't automatically recognize the proper format and I really do not want to leave SNDM tool only for such a little problem.<br>
<br>
Maybe is the only fast and viable solution is to recompile all - forcing in the rpg source "text/plain" instead of "application/octet-stream"? Maybe creating two command sndm ( your default ) and sndmp ( for plain text attachments )?<br>
<br>
Do I need to change only the sndm rpg source relaunching the whole compiling procedure?<br>
<br>
thanks you much for your support, let me know if this is possible and any advices for recompilation.<br>
<br>
thanks!<br>
