I have downloaded and tested your CRTCSVF utility and found it to be exactly what I need ... with two exceptions.<br>
1.  I have a file that is 105 fields and you state that your utility will only work with 100 field.<br>
2.  Your utility will not add to a stream file, only replace.<br>
<br>
I am writing to confirm that these two points are still correct and have not been changed.<br>
<br>
Thanks very much for your time.<br>
