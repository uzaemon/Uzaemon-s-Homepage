> I tried to install CRTCSVF.  After FTPing the save file to the AS400 and displaying the objects, I don't see QTXTSRC.  I only see the following objects:  LICENSE, SOURCE, CRTCSVF, CRTCSVFHLP.  Do I need QTXTSRC?<br>
<br>
No, it's documentation error and I've already corrected it. You need only "SOURCE" to compile the software.<br>
<br>
Thank you very much for your suggestion.<br>
