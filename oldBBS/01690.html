> I using your tiff2pdf 3.4, I recompile on O/S 5.4 AND i use your HPT 0.04 for create TIFF file.I Don't make any change on your TIFF2PDF. I wrote JVMs because I DON'T KNOW your utility and i don't Know that api use, I AM NOT  VERY expert.   I open PDF FILE WHITH ACROBAT READER 5.0, 6.0 AND 7.0 and all program produce same error.<br>
> Help you and excuse me for my english<br>
I FIND THE ERROR, IF I READ WHIT WORDPAD THE PDF FILE I FIND THAT IN PROGRAM TIFF2PDF "  sprintf( buff, "q \n%f 0 0 %f %f %f cm /%s%d Do \nQ \n" , x_bounding,<br>
    y_bounding, x_translate, y_translate, img_name, img_nr ) ;"         x_bounding, y_bounding, x_translate, y_traslate are numer whit ',' exemple 543,5555 instead 543.555<br>
