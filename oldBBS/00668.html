See message "626. Re: CRTCSVF (no QSYSINC library)" in this BBS. It points many messages which are same as your question.<br>
<br>
| You have to install QSYSINC as I stated at my homepage ("! Read before you start !").<br>
|<br>
| See messages "268. Re: SNDM: Problem running STRREXPRC SRCMBR(MAKE) ", "159. Re: SNDM compilation problem", "129. Re: Library QSYSINC", "109. Re: CRTCSVFRPG compiling error", "66. Re: /COPY" and "49. Re: SMTP" in this BBS for more information.<br>
|<br>
| Hope this helps.<br>
<br>
If they doesn't help, let me know.<br>
