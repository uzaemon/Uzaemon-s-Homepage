<br>
Thank you for using SNDM.<br>
<br>

<br>
I don't have a plan to implement SMTP AUTH, because:<br>
- My mail server does not require authentication.<br>
- It is not so easy to implement "SMTP Authentication" defined by RFC2554, the full auth mechanism (AUTH-LOGIN, AUTH PLAIN, AUTH CRAM-MD5, etc).<br>
- I'm very busy on my regular work and private things.<br>
<br>

So it is a very good chance for you to contribute to the community!<br>
