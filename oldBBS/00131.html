Hi, I would like to use ZLIB with *SAVF to make daily backups smaller. You recommend to convert save files to  stream file using CPYTOSTMF/CPYFRMSTMF.<br>
Could you be so kind and help me with syntax of these commands, (I don't know what is wrong, but I'm not able to convert save file to physical file member).<br>
Thanks, Al.<br>
