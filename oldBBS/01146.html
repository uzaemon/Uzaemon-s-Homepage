SNDM is subject to the dual-license which means you can use whichever you want. You need commercial license when you want to "SELL" SNDM. I assume most people prefer GPL and I don't want to receive lengthy legal documents to sign.<br>
<br>
If you are planning to use SNDM just for your commercial application, you can use SNDM under GPL. There are some issues regarding "dynamically links". I don't think programs which call SNDM are not "derivative work". For more information, refer to <a href="http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/GPL</a>, for instance.<br>
<br>
Hope this answers to your question.<br>
