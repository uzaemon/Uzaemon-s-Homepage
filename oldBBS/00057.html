Thanks for your posts. I determined the problem (I hope...) and put test version of SMTP client program on my server. Please download <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/smtp130.exe" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/smtp130.exe</a> and try again.<br>
<br>
Just for your information, as I don't have pure German environment, I tested under following settings to emulate German environment as much as possible:<br>
- AS/400 primary language 2962(Japanese), secondary 2924(US English)<br>
- Specify 273 as codepage of Client Access terminal session and select German keyboard<br>
- Create new subsystem description and specify QSYS2924<br>
- Exec 'CHGJOB CCSID(273)' before run sndm.<br>
Under this environment, sndm works fine with '@' character and some German characters in from/to/subject/body.<br>
<br>
I appreciate your time and waiting for your reply.<br>
