> Hy I'm trying to change your source for supporting cirilic, all the secret is to translate from ccsid 1025 Or Job Ccsid, to the CCSID 1251.<br>
> The question is : can i use iconv_index ?? I think you use it for handle many iconv() instances, because of the Open, convert,close sequence of this treatment.<br>
<br>
Just try. If iconv() does not support 1025 to 1251 conversion, SNDM (iconv_open()) will report error.<br>

> Another procedure that I must read carefully is QEncode, I think that I can use it without any change, I only need that the source string be a 1025 CCSID hexas stream.<br>
<br>
I don't know if Q-encoding is appropriate for Cirilic because it depends on language you use, in other words, common sense works here.<br>
<br>
To handle Japanese (DBCS), B-encoding is used for header, and ISO-2022-JP charset without special encoding is used for body part. To handle ASCII and ISO-8859-1 languages (SBCS), Q-encoding is used for header, and quoted-printable is used for body part when necessary.<br>
<br>

<br>
One suggestion. You should investigate and change header information from "ISO-8859-1" to another charset which supports Cirilic.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
