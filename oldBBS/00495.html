According to your investigation, only combination of SNDM and "Local SMTP server" has problem.<br>
 SNDM -> Local SMTP server ...slow<br>
 SNDM -> Remote SMTP server ...fast<br>
 Other mailer -> Local SMTP server ...fast<br>
 SNDDST -> Local SMTP server ...fast<br>
<br>
Assumptions:<br>
- "Local SMTP server" is your AS/400.<br>
- You are running SNDM and SNDDST on the same AS/400 (Local SMTP server).<br>
- "Remote SMTP Server" is something else, may be UNIX or Windows or OS/400.<br>
- You are always specifying the same recipient.<br>
<br>
>... but I don't understand, why it works slowly with SmtpHosT(*LocalHost) parameter.<br>
<br>
I also don't know why... Please answer to questions below:<br>
<br>
- Are above assumptions correct?<br>
- What is the version and PTF level of your OS/400?<br>
- What happens if you change line 16 of SMTP/QREXSRC.MAKE from "OPTION = 0" to "OPTION = 1" and recompile the distribution.<br>
- If you have another AS/400, do you encounter the same slow-down?<br>
- Does the slow-down occurs always, or occasionally?<br>
- If the slow-down always happens, please run the SNDM twice and send two debug logs to my mail address.<br>
<br>
I'm not sure but I believe most AS/400 shops use SNDM without such phenomenon, so this problem may be specific to your AS/400 system.<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
