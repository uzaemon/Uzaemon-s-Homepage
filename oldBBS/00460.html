As stated at "95. *IPDS spool files", SPL2STMF is just a front-end to IBM supplied API. Contact your support channel and ask if IBM provides WSCST for your specific purpose.<br>
<br>
Possibilities are, you may try QSYS/QWPHPDBCS to generate DBCS PCL output though I don't know if it support Traditional Chainese.<br>
