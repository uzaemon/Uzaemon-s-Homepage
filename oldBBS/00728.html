Hi,<br>
Thanks for your prompt response. For me to talk to the Mail Server Administrator, could you tell me the underlying technique used in the SNDM. i.e, what API is used for this purpose? Or is it socket programming using TCP/IP? Your response is very much appreciated.<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
Uday<br>
