<br>
To recompile the distribution, use (or study) "MAKE" REXX procedure as described at installation document (<a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/zlib_install.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/zlib_install.html</a>).<br>

<br>
Make sure that you have installed library QSYSINC (header files) on your AS/400. The complie messages, "not prototyped" are warning and you can just ignore them.<br>
