SNDM supports US-ASCII, ISO-8859-1 and ISO-2022-JP as stated at my homepage. See <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/iso8859.html" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/iso8859.html</a> for more information. Polish (ISO-8859-2?) and other languages have not been tested and will not work correctly.<br>

I don't think of why you see CCSID 5035 which is "Japanese Latin Extended", because I packaged SNDM using CCSID 37, "US English". What CCSID does your QRPGLESRC have? Is the source file original, or did you created the source file with CCSID 5035 by some reason?<br>
