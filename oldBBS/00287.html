Hi, I've downloaded SPL2STMF early and it's working fine when is used to convert text-only spooled files to TIFF images; but I've some problems:<br>
<br>
1. I don't know what WSCST object I must use, after several attempts I'd found QSYS/QWPTIFFG4 and QSYS/QWPTIFFPB but I don't know if there are other objects more recomended.<br>
<br>
2. When the spooled file to convert has overlays, the data falls down around one line in the format.<br>
<br>
3. When I use PCL escape secuences those commands are not converted, and I can read them as a part of the data. Some time ago I created WSCSTs to print reports with escape secuences in HP printers if I use any of these customizing objects the TIFF file generated is 'Invalid file or type not supported'.<br>
<br>
