> 1. I don't know what WSCST object I must use, after several attempts I'd found QSYS/QWPTIFFG4 and QSYS/QWPTIFFPB but I don't know if there are other objects more recomended.<br>
<br>
I don't know either (it depends). As stated at "95. *IPDS spool files" SPL2STMF is just a front-end to IBM supplied API. Contact your support channel and ask IBM about "recommended" WSCST for your specific purpose.<br>
<br>
As far as I know, QWPTIFFG4 should be used to generate a TIFF file for TIFF2PDF command.<br>

<br>
SPL2STMF has nothing to do with contents. To determine the problem and report to IBM, try LPR on your AS/400. Use LPD software for PC or UNIX to store stream file. Some LPD softwares have capability to store the printer output as stream file instead of send it to the printer.<br>
<br>
> 3. When I use PCL escape secuences those commands are not converted, and I can read them as a part of the data. Some time ago I created WSCSTs to print reports with escape secuences in HP printers if I use any of these customizing objects the TIFF file generated is 'Invalid file or type not supported'.<br>
<br>
I don't understand what you want to do. Are you trying to create a TIFF file using WSCST for PCL data stream?<br>
