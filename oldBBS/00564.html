Hi Uzaemon, I've used SPL2STMF without any problem since 18 months ago, but recently we upgrade OS from V4R4M0 to V5R1M0 and since then when I convert some spooled files I get the following error:<br>
<br>
Command failed. reason - API QwpzHostPrintTransform failed : CPF3CF2  hptopt = 30<br>
<br>
I will post you the debug print output in a reply to this message.<br>
<br>
What I try to convert is an *SCS spooled file with length of 20 pages and a file size of 180 KB, using 15CPI x 8LPI at 198 COLS and 88 ROWS per page.<br>
<br>
I thought it was a problem with the user spaces' sizes and I changed them from 1024 to 2048 for QSPGETSP and 200000 to 400000 for QWPZHPT1, and increased value of hptxbuflen variable in D-spec initialization from 200000 to 400000. After this, the problem remains and most of the tiff files were generated empty.<br>
<br>
Can you help me?<br>
<br>
Regards.<br>
<br>
Jesus<br>
