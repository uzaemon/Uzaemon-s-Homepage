I shutdown the subsystems QSNADS, QSERVER and QSYSWRK and I don't know if this is affecting the SNDDST command.  Then I found your utility SNDM and I wondered if this would overcome this problem by writing directly to the SMTP server.  Does this utility in terms of subsystems and AS400 services running?<br>

I ran the test lat night and I received the folowing error message...<br>
<br>
Message . . . . :   Command failed. reason -201 failed to start TCP/IP<br>
  communication (socket(), 3448:The protocol required to support the specified<br>
  address family is not available at this time.)<br>
<br>
Therefore I checked the subsystems and I assume that TCP/IP runs in both QSERVER and QSYSWRK and as these were ended so would TCP/IP even though it was none as a ENDTCP command. This would be done to ensure a full save.<br>
I guess I will have to try and find another way round this problem unless you know of one.<br>
<br>
