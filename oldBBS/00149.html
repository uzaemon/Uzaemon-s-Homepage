> I try to convert from AFP to GIF, and Zetafax like it very much, but when my AFP document is more lenght then 1 page, SPL2STMF only create an image GIF with the first page.<br>
<br>
SPL2STMF is just a front-end to QwpzHostPrintTransform API. Most functionalities depend on the API which is provided from IBM. If the API cannot generate multi-page(?) GIF image, SPL2STMF has nothing to do with your problem.<br>
<br>
You may<br>
<br>
- ask IBM if API QwpzHostPrintTransform has the capability to generate multi-page(?) GIF file.<br>
<br>
- generate a multi-page TIFF, split the image to multiple files (one image file per page), convert them to GIF, then send them using your FAX software. See messages, '119. Re: Selecting certain pages to convert to TIFF with SPL2STMF' and '128. Re: GIF FILE QUALITY' for related information.<br>

<br>
Thanks for your report. I hope you have some fun using them.<br>
