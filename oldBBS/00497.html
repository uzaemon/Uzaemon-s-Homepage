> I think they are correct. But I have a question. If I use AS/400 as SMTP gateway (no mail server, only gateway to route an e-mail to mail server) is the same that AS/400 is the local SMTP server? Maybe I use SndM wrongly?<br>
<br>
INHO, SMTP "gateway" is actually normal SMTP server. SMTP server simply forwards (relays) mail to upper SMTP server if the mail recipient's domain is not the same.<br>

MF27767 is dated 02/06/24 so it is not so obsolete.<br>

I18N of OS/400 sometimes causes annoying side-effect. Some special characters such as "[" might have been unexpectedly translated.<br>

Thank you, and I confirmed that the slow-down always occurs at exactly the same point, where waiting response to "MAIL FROM:" and "RCPT TO:" SMTP commands...<br>
<br>
OK... one more question. Do you have ILE-C compiler?<br>
