> ... One more question, is it possible to have the program only write to the RCVMLOG file and not download the mail to the user directories?<br>
<br>
It is possible if you modify RCVM to do so.<br>
<br>
Or create temporary directory, use RCVM as it is specifying the directory, then remove the temporary directory (by "rm" qshell command, for example).<br>
<br>
Otherwise you may look for another program which meets your special requirement.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
