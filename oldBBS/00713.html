> I need to know the name of the attachment which has been received with the RCVM. Is there anyway I can change the Rcvmail.java so that I can list it in the RCVMLOG file?<br>
<br>
I developed RCVM mainly for B2B mail solution. In this case, I assume that the naming rule of attachment file must be pre-negotiated between companies.<br>
<br>
Still, if you want to modify RCVM, you can find the attachment file by "disposition" attribute. Or you may create new program which looks for attachment files in the mail directory (available from RCVM log file) in some manner.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
