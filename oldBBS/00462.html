Hello,<br>
<br>
Downloaded the SNDM command today. VERY nice and the install directions are the best I've seen for stuff like this !<br>
<br>
So I tried SNDM and it says it sent an email but I have yet to receive it. How/where do I check to see what is going on with this on the AS/400 ? I've looked and looked through all the TCP/IP stuff, etc, and cannot find anything.<br>
<br>
Thanks !<br>
<br>
Chuck<br>
