Hi, I just want to know, if SNDM support Cyrillic (Russian) in the Body and the Attach.<br>
The problem we have is that some characters are coverted to a Cyrillic letter but it doesen't make a readable Word.<br>
And also invert tha case of the leters, I mean lower case to upper and viceversa.<br>
<br>
Do I have to use 1025 as a CCSID?? in Header and Body??<br>
If I create the STMF for the attachment, wich CCSID do I have to use? NOw I'm using 819.<br>
<br>
Thanks, and sorry if you don't understand something, I'm from Argentina.<br>
