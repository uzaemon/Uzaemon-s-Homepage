I'm using the minizip utility and it's working great.  I do have one problem with it.  I need to create zip files that do not contain the orginal path in the zipped files properties.  I.E. \mega\storage\text.doc.  What happens when I restore the file it's building the directories from the orginal file location.  I tried using parm -P- (pkzip parm to not add path info) and it will not work.  Any thoughts?  Thanks,  Scott  ps. I tried numerous other parms without success.<br>
