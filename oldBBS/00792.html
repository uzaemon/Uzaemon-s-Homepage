Hi,<br>
<br>
> 1. Did you make the utility by yourself?<br>
R: I downloaded it from your site and followed your instruction. I've just modifified part of the SPL2TIFF to add system name, date and time to api call ・to allow job names with *  (I can send you this version if you want).<br>
<br>
> 2. Do you see the message for all PDF file generated by SPL2STMF and TIFF2PDF?<br>
R: Yes. Also with a very small one.<br>
<br>
> 3. What is the version of your OS/400?<br>
R: V5R2<br>
<br>
> 4. What version of PDF reader are you using? Are you using only specific version of PDF reader (or viewer)?<br>
R: Acrobat reader 6.<br>
However I知 also using a spool converter with iText java classes and they open fine with AReader6.<br>
<br>
> 5. What is the primary (or execution environment) language of your OS/400.<br>
R: QCCSID is 65535 and language Italian.<br>
<br>
> 6. Which JOBCCSID are you using? If you create the PDF under JOBCCSID 65535, do you see any difference?<br>
R:I've tried to create again the C/TIFF2PDFC many times with ccsid 037, 280 and 65535. I've also tried to rebuild the ebcdic2ascii table in C program with a 037->850 table obtained from api CDRCVRT but it still gives also the same message.<br>
<br>
Note that after this message the PDF looks fine also with AFP spools with many pages.<br>
<br>
Thanks.<br>
Beppe.<br>
