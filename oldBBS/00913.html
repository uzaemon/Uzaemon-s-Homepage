> I tried to convert AFPDS spool files with a coloured overlay using SPL2STMF (both QWPTIFFG4 than QWPTIFFPB) but it seems impossible to create a TIFF coloured file. Also AFPTOOL doesn't create coloured TIF file. Is SPL2STMF working only with black & white overlays ?<br>
<br>
SPL2STMF is just a frontend to IBM supplied API (Host Print Transform), so please ask IBM via your support channel.<br>
