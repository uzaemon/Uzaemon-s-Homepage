<br>
Thanks for sending me a mail and files.<br>
<br>
First, I see no problem with your TIFF file, WRKSTS.TIFF (though lines are folded to the same line because page width of printer file had not been set to enough size, I guess).<br>
<br>
Second, I loaded your PDF file (WRKSTS.PDF) and only see blank page on my Acrobat reader (Acrobat Exchange 3.01J). Appearently something wrong with the PDF file.<br>
<br>
Thirdly, I ran TIFF2PDF and create WRKSTS2.PDF on my AS/400(V4R4,Cum-TL00049) from WRKSTS.TIFF and it worked just fine. You can see my PDF at <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/wrksts2.pdf" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/wrksts2.pdf</a><br>
<br>
Then I took 'diff' between WRKSTS.PDF(yours) and WRKSTS2.PDF(mine). There are about 10 differences but the essential difference is here.<br>
<br>
******** C:\My Documents\wrksts2.pdf 113<br>
/Count 1 /Type /Pages /MediaBox [ 0 0 595 842 ]<br>
<br>
-------- C:\My Documents\wrksts.pdf 113<br>
/Count 1 /Type /Pages /MediaBox [ 0 0 -889710572 1096098590 ]<br>
<br>
In source code (TIFFLIB/TIFF2PDF.TIFF2PDFC), the line is described as follows.<br>
<br>
0528.00 j = sprintf(wbuf, " ] \n/Count %d /Type /Pages /MediaBox [ 0 0 %d %d ]\n>>\nendobj\n",<br>
0529.00 dircount - 1, (int)A4W, (int)A4H ) ;<br>
<br>
'A4W' and 'A4H' are just constants and should be set as they are. I can not think of anything why they can be changed to abnormal value.<br>
<br>
0107.00 #define A4W 595.0<br>
0108.00 #define A4H 842.0<br>
<br>
Please check followings:<br>
<br>
- If you have modified the source code, discard all changes and try again.<br>
- If you have not, apply latest Cum-PTF to your AS/400.<br>
- If you are not on V4R4, plan to install V4R4 (same as my test environment), or I cannot pursue this issue.<br>
<br>
Hope this helps.<br>
