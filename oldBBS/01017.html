Additional information:<br>
<br>
The first time, MiniZip was successfully called 296 times before it stopped working. The second time, it was only successfully called 123 times. The third time, only 118 times.<br>
<br>
I can privately email you an excerpt from the joblog of the second run. (Believe me, you don't want the whole thing, with its thousand odd pages of the same error message)<br>
