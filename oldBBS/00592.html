Basically, SMTP server does not require userid and password unless the server limit access by "POP before SMTP" or such.<br>
<br>
Please confirm followings to determine your problem.<br>
<br>
- What is your mail server, OS/400 or other mail server?<br>
<br>
- If you use OS/400 as mail server, is that working properly? (SMTP jobs (QTSM*) are running, QSNADS subsystem is up, MSF is running, etc.)<br>
<br>
- If you try to send a mail to the same mail server by using other mail client (e.g. Outlook Express or Netscape Messenger), do you see the same (or similar) error?<br>
<br>
Waiting for your reply.<br>
