Yes. What I'm wondering is how, when it's specifically bound to QTCP/QZHBCGI at creation time, it's somehow successfully finding QHTTPSVR/QZHBCGI at run time. By contrast, if a program is bound to ZLIB/ZLIB at creation time, it's unable to find ZLIB anywhere else, even if it's in the library list. I'm not looking a gift horse in the mouth about QZHBCGI here; I'm just puzzled.<br>
