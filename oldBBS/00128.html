<br>
I tried it and got same result on V4R5. Image resolution of GIF file is much lower than TIFF (see <a href="http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/tiff_gif.png" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://homepage1.nifty.com/uzaemon/tiff_gif.png</a> ).<br>

<br>
TIFF has better quality and I don't know why it's not enough for you. Anyway I think you have two options:<br>
<br>
- Ask IBM if QWPGIF can generate better image. As RTVWSCST is not available for QWPGIF, you need to ask IBM through your standard support process.<br>
<br>
- Convert TIFF to GIF. You can find some tools (for ANSI-C) on the Web, for example, check out <a href="http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~alberto/tiff/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://cfa-www.harvard.edu/~alberto/tiff/</a> , <a href="http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://netpbm.sourceforge.net/</a> , <a href="http://kalex.engin.umich.edu/tif2gif/" rel = "nofollow" target = "_blank">http://kalex.engin.umich.edu/tif2gif/</a> and many more.<br>
