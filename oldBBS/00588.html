I am having a problem with the SNDM utility sending out an email with a PDF attachment, I am emailing it to a domain that is running IronMail and it is spitting it out with an error that the email was not created with proper MIME boundries. I am wondering what the problem is, I downloaded the latest version of the code and tried it and it is having the same problem. Does the MIME encoding in the SNDM conform to the standards?<br>
<br>
Thanks,<br>
