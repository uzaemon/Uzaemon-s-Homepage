<H3>Analog is free software, but its usage, distribution and modification are covered by a licence. You must agree to the terms of the licence before using the program. In particular, it comes with no warranty.

<PRE>
Analog is copyright (c) Stephen R. E. Turner 1995 - 2000.
This copyright applies to all source code, compiled code, documentation,
graphics and auxiliary files, except those parts written by other people
(which are normally copyright their authors). The licence applies to the
whole program.

This licence describes the conditions under which you may use, modify and
distribute version 4.11 of analog ("the program"). Except where stated,
the conditions of this licence apply equally to the source code for the
program, as well as to any compiled version. The form interface program is
part of the program for the purposes of this licence. If you are unable or
unwilling to accept these conditions in full, then, notwithstanding the
conditions in the remainder of this licence, you may not use, modify or
distribute the program at all. Text in square brackets is intended for
guidance only and does not form part of the licence in any way.
[Analog is free software. This licence is designed not to restrict your
freedom except insofar as is necessary to ensure that the program remains free
for all. If you want to do something that is against this licence, but within
the spirit of free software, then let's talk about it.]

1) Any use of analog which is illegal under international or local law is
   forbidden by this licence. Any such action is the sole responsibility of
   the person committing the action.
   [Some jurisdictions regulate the collection and processing of data relating
   to individuals, for example.]

2) The program may be used free of charge by any person or organisation to
   whom it is made available, provided that that person accepts the conditions
   of this licence.

3) The program may be copied and distributed by any person or organisation in
   any way whatsoever, provided that any distribution is accompanied by a copy
   of all the documentation pertaining to the program. You may not charge
   for the program itself, only for reasonable costs of distributing the
   program, and you must not do anything to suggest to the person to whom it is
   distributed that analog is anything other than free software. Furthermore,
   you may not charge for distributing a modified version of the program
   unless the source code for the modified version, or a list of differences
   between the modified version and the original version, is publicly and
   freely available in machine readable form.
   [If you distribute analog with a book or a magazine or something like that,
   I'd be pleased to receive a copy].

4) You may make a reasonable charge for either of the following services,
   provided in each case that the third party is first made aware that analog
   is free software and that the charge is therefore for your labour,
   expertise and costs.
   i) Installing the program on a computer on behalf of a third party;
  ii) Running the program and providing output from it to a third party.
   You may not charge for these services in connection with a modified version
   of the program unless the source code for the modified version, or a list
   of differences between the modified version and the original version, is
   publicly and freely available in machine readable form.

5) If you use more than 1000 lines of the source code of the program, modified
   or unmodified, in your own program, than your program shall be considered
   to be a modified version of the program. You may modify the program in any
   way you wish provided that all of the following conditions are met.
   i) Any modification in the source code is clearly marked as such;
  ii) An unmodified copy of my documentation is distributed with your program;
      [Any documentation needed on your changes must therefore be made in a
      separate file].
 iii) The version number of the program is changed to avoid conflict with
      analog's version numbers.
      [For example, you could change the VNUMBER at the top of anlghea3.h to
      "4.11(modified)"].
  iv) Any HTML output includes a link to the analog home page.
   v) All of the conditions of this licence, and no other conditions, apply to
      your modified version.
   You may claim copyright for the parts of the program you have written.
   Changing the default options in the file anlghead.h and anlghea2.h does not
   count as modifying the program.
   [You are encouraged to submit your changes to me for inclusion in subsequent
   versions of analog].

6) You may use up to 1000 lines of the source code of the program, modified or
   unmodified, in your own program provided that both of the following
   conditions are met.
   i) Authorship of the code is correctly attributed, both in the source code
      for your program, and in the documentation for your program if there is
      any;
  ii) Your program must be used, modified and distributed (a) as a modified
      version of analog under this licence, or (b) under version 2 or later of
      the Gnu General Public Licence, or (c) under the current version of the
      Perl Artistic Licence, at your option.
   [See http://www.gnu.org/copyleft/gpl.html and
   http://language.perl.com/misc/Artistic.html respectively].

7) No warranty of any sort, expressed or implied, is provided in connection
   with the program, including, but not limited to, implied warranties of
   merchantibility or fitness for a particular purpose. Any cost, loss or
   damage of any sort incurred owing to the malfunction or misuse of the
   program or the inaccuracy of the documentation or connected with the program
   in any other way whatsoever is the responsibility of the person who incurred
   the cost, loss or damage. By using this program you give up any right to
   seek any damages against me in connection with this program.

8) I, Stephen Turner, reserve the right to make exceptions to any of these
   conditions, or alter these conditions, at any time. However, you may always
   use these conditions instead of any altered version if you prefer.
   [Note that this licence explicitly applies only to one version of
   analog. Therefore, if I make new conditions in connection with a future
   version, you do not then have the right to apply these conditions to that
   version instead].
