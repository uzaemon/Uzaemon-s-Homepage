<PRE>                      Send SMTP Mail (SNDM) - Help

    The Send SMTP Mail (SNDM) command allows you to send a Internet
    compliant mail from AS/400 command line.

    Some of the specific functions that can be performed by the SNDM
    command include the following:

     o  US-ASCII, Latin-1 (German, French, etc.) or Japanese can be used
        as mail header and mail body text.

     o  SNDM command talks with SMTP (mail) server directly by TCP/IP
        socket interface. You should enable TCP/IP and configure
        domain/host name on the AS/400 before running SNDM command.
        Also you should configure your AS/400 to use DNS (Domain Name
        System) server or 'hosts' file for SNDM command to resolve IP
        address from TCP/IP host name.

     o  In default, SNDM command assumes the same AS/400 running the
        command as SMTP server. In this case, you should configure the
        AS/400 as mail (SMTP) server.  If you already have SMTP server
        running on other host, you can use it by specifying the server
        at SMTPHOST parameter.

     o  System date/time is referred when generating date filed in mail
        header.  Make sure that QDATE, QTIME, QUTCOFFSET system values
        are set correctly.

     o  SNDM command creates temporary stream file in directory
        specified at TMPDIR parameter.  The path name will be:
        '/(tmpdir)/SNDM_(job number)-(user name)-(job
        name)_(date).(time).TXT' For example:
        '/tmp/SNDM_90605-TCPIP-QPADEV0006_1999-01-20-17.33.19.215.TXT'

        The temporary file reamins if you specify DEBUG(*YES).  Even you
        specify DEBUG(*NO), the temporary file might not be removerd by
        SNDM command automaically if SNDM command ends abnormally.  Use
        WRKLNK command or any other IFS-accessible function to delete
        the file when you don't need the temporary file.

     o  See low level message or joblog when error occured.  SNDM
        command creates spooled file QPRINT which records all activities
        in the command when you specify DEBUG(*YES).

     o  Wait time (time out interval) depends on the socket
        communication phase.  Usually, SNDM command times out in 1 to 3
        minutes when SMTP server doesn't respond.  If you are sending
        small mail but SNDM doesn't finish for several minutes, cancel
        the command manually.

     o  Refer to RFC 821, 822, 1468, 2045, 2046, 2047, 2048, 2049

    Restrictions:

      1.  Mail body text (physical file member specified at FILE
          parameter) and attachment files (stream file(s) specified at
          ATTACHMENT parameter) can be sent. Attachment files cannot be
          objects in QSYS.LIB file system.

      2.  Maximum number of recipients ('to' and 'cc' and 'bcc') is 30
          due to the restiriction of AS/400 CPP (maximum length of
          command string = 6000 bytes).  Maximum field length of mail
          addr, description, subject are 64 bytes respectively.

      3.  'Content-type' of mail body will be set to 'text/plain'.
          Other text formats such as HTML or RTF are not supported.  For
          attachment files, 'Contents-type' will be set to
          'application/octet-stream'.

      4.  For (safe) US-ASCII characters, no encoding will take place.
          For unsafe ASCII and 8bit ISO-8859-1 characters, Q-encoding
          will be used to encode mail header and quoted-printable
          encoding will be used for mail body.  For Japanese characters,
          B-encoding will be used to encode mail header. Body text will
          be converted to ISO-2022-JP.  For attachment files, Base64
          encoding is always used.  Other MIME encodings such as nesting
          are not supported.

      5.  EBCDIC Japanese CCSIDs (5026/5035/1390/1399) will be converted
          to ISO-2022-JP.  You cannot send a mail by other Japanese
          codes such as Shift-JIS(x-sjis) or EUC.  SBCS katakana will be
          replaced by DBCS katakana.  Non-JIS defined DBCS characters
          will be replace by thick '=' character or SNDM terminates in
          error depending on NONJISDBCS parameter.

        Note:  Do not precede an entry with an asterisk unless that
        entry is a &quot;special value&quot; that is shown (on the display or in
        the help information) with an asterisk.

Debug print out (DEBUG)

    Specify if you want QPRINT spooled file to examine how the command
    works.  The purpose of this parameter is problem determination and
    you should use DEBUG(*NO) in normal operation to avoid performance
    degradation.

    The possible values are:

    <U>*NO</U>
        No spooled file is generated.
